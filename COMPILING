What architecture?
------------------

CPROVER compiles in the following environments:

- Linux

- MacOS X

- Cygwin
  (We recommend g++-3. Don't use the i686-pc-mingw32-g++ cross compiler.)

- Microsoft's Visual Studio 2010 (older versions won't work)

You need to adjust config.inc to reflect the environment. The default is
set up for a recent version of Linux.


How to compile?
---------------

Follow these instructions:

0) You need a C/C++ compiler, Flex and Bison, and GNU make.
   If you have Windows, and don't have these, we recommend you
   install Cygwin.

1) You need a SAT solver (in source). We recommend MiniSat2. Many
   Linux distributions now have a package for MiniSat2; e.g.,
   try "apt-get install minisat2" on Debian-like distributions.

   Alternatively, the source of MiniSat2 can be be downloaded at
   the following address:

   http://minisat.se/downloads/minisat-2.2.0.tar.gz

   MiniSat2 relies on zlib, which you have to obtain for your environment.

   Alternatively, you may use zchaff, Booleforce, or
   SMV-SAT (if you work for Cadence).

2) Adjust src/config.inc for the paths to item 1).

3) If desired, adjust src/solvers/sat/satcheck.h to select which SAT
   solver to use (MiniSat2 with simplifier is the default).

4) Adjust the file src/utils/hash_cont.h

   Depending on the version of your STL, you may need to adjust a preprocessor
   command:

   a) Recent versions of Linux run with "STL_HASH_TR1".
   b) Recent versions of Cygwin/MingW work with "STL_HASH_TR1";
      for g++-3, use "STL_HASH_GNU".
   c) Visual Studio: please get Visual Studio 10 and use "STL_HASH_TR1".

   Older Linux or MingW systems may require "STL_HASH_GNU".

5) Type cd src; make - that should do it.
