What architecture?
------------------

CPROVER now needs a C++11 compliant compiler and works in the following
environments:

- Linux

- MacOS X

- Solaris 11

- FreeBSD 11

- Cygwin
  (We recommend the i686-pc-mingw32-g++ cross compiler, version 5.4 or above.)

- Microsoft's Visual Studio version 12 (2013), version 14 (2015),
  or version 15 (older versions won't work)

The rest of this document is split up into three parts: compilation on
Linux, MacOS, Windows.  Please read the section appropriate for your
machine.


COMPILATION ON LINUX
--------------------

We assume that you have a Debian/Ubuntu or Red Hat-like distribution.

0) You need a C/C++ compiler, Flex and Bison, and GNU make.
   The GNU Make needs to be version 3.81 or higher.
   On Debian-like distributions, do

   apt-get install g++ gcc flex bison make git libwww-perl patch

   On Red Hat/Fedora or derivates, do

   yum install gcc gcc-c++ flex bison perl-libwww-perl patch devtoolset-6

   Note that you need g++ version 4.9 or newer.

1) As a user, get the CBMC source via

   git clone https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc cbmc-git

2) On Debian or Ubuntu, do

   cd cbmc-git/src
   make minisat2-download
   make

   On Redhat/Fedora etc., do

   cd cbmc-git/src
   make minisat2-download
   scl enable devtoolset-6 bash
   make


COMPILATION ON SOLARIS 11
-------------------------

1) As root, get the necessary development tools:

   pkg install system/header developer/lexer/flex developer/parser/bison developer/versioning/git
   pkg install --accept developer/gcc/gcc-c++-5

2) As a user, get the CBMC source via

   git clone https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc cbmc-git

3) Get MiniSat2 by entering

   cd cbmc-git
   wget http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/minisat2/minisat2_2.2.1.orig.tar.gz
   gtar xfz minisat_2.2.1.orig.tar.gz
   mv minisat2-2.2.1 minisat-2.2.1
   (cd minisat-2.2.1; patch -p1 < ../scripts/minisat-2.2.1-patch)

4) Type

   cd src; gmake

   That should do it. To run, you will need

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/gcc/4.9/lib


COMPILATION ON FREEBSD 11
-------------------------

1) As root, get the necessary tools:

   pkg install bash gmake git www/p5-libwww patch flex bison

2) As a user, get the CBMC source via

   git clone https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc cbmc-git

3) Do

   cd cbmc-git/src

4) Do

   gmake minisat2-download
   gmake


COMPILATION ON MACOS X
----------------------

Follow these instructions:

0) You need a C/C++ compiler, Flex and Bison, and GNU make. To this
   end, first install the XCode from the App-store and then type

   xcode-select --install

   in a terminal window.

1) Then get the CBMC source via

   git clone https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc cbmc-git

2) Then type

   cd cbmc-git/src
   make minisat2-download
   make


COMPILATION ON WINDOWS
----------------------

There are two options: compilation using g++ from Cygwin, or using
Visual Studio's compiler. As Cygwin has significant overhead during
process creation, we advise you use Visual Studio.

Follow these instructions:

0) You need a C/C++ compiler, Flex and Bison, GNU tar, gzip2,
   GNU make, and patch. The GNU Make needs to be version 3.81 or
   higher.  If you don't already have the above, we recommend you install
   Cygwin.

1) You need a SAT solver (in source). We recommend MiniSat2. Using a
   browser, download from

   http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/minisat2/minisat2_2.2.1.orig.tar.gz

   and then unpack with

   tar xfz minisat-2.2.1.tar.gz
   mv minisat minisat-2.2.1
   cd minisat-2.2.1
   patch -p1 < ../scripts/minisat-2.2.1-patch

   The patch removes the dependency on zlib and prevents a problem
   with a header file that is often unavailable on Windows.

2A) To compile with Cygwin, install the mingw compilers, and adjust
   the second line of config.inc to say

   BUILD_ENV = MinGW

2B) To compile with Visual Studio, make sure you have at least Visual
   Studio version 12 (2013), and adjust the second line of config.inc to say

   BUILD_ENV = MSVC

   Open the Visual Studio Command prompt, and then bash.exe -login from
   Cygwin from in there. 

3) Type cd src; make - that should do it.


(Optional) A Visual Studio project file can be generated with the script
"generate_vcxproj" that is in the subdirectory "scripts".  The project file
is helpful for GUI-based tasks, e.g., the class viewer, debugging, etc., and
can be used for building with MSBuild.  Note that you still need to run
flex/bison using "make generated_files" before opening the project.


WORKING WITH ECLIPSE
--------------------

To work with Eclipse, do the following:

1) Select File -> New -> Makefile Project with Existing Code

2) Type "cprover" as "Project Name"

3) Select the "src" subdirectory as "Existing Code Location"

4) Select a toolchain appropriate for your platform

5) Click "Finish"

6) Select Project -> Build All


CODE COVERAGE
-------------

Code coverage metrics are provided using gcov and lcov. Ensure that you
have installed lcov from http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php
note for ubuntu lcov is available in the standard apt-get repos.

To get coverage metrics run the following script from the regression
directory:

  get_coverage.sh

This will:
 1) Rebuild CBMC with gcov enabled
 2) Run all the regression tests
 3) Collate the coverage metrics
 4) Provide an HTML report of the current coverage
