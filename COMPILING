What architecture?
------------------

CPROVER compiles in the following environments:

- Linux

- MacOS X

- Cygwin
  (We recommend g++-3. Don't use the i686-pc-mingw32-g++ cross compiler.)

- Microsoft's Visual Studio 2010 or 2012 (older versions won't work)

The rest of this document is split up into three parts: compilation on
Linux, MacOS, Windows.  Please read the section appropriate for your
machine.


COMPILATION ON LINUX
--------------------

We assume that you have a Debian/Ubuntu-like distribution.

0) You need a C/C++ compiler, Flex and Bison, and GNU make.
   The GNU Make needs to be version 3.81 or higher. Do

   apt-get install g++ gcc flex bison make subversion libz-dev libwww-perl

   WARNING: g++ 4.5.x has been observed to mis-optimize code in
   MiniSat with -O3. Use a different version (or -O1).

1) You need a SAT solver (in source). We recommend MiniSat2. Do

   cd src
   make minisat2-download

   Alternatively, you may use zchaff, Booleforce, or
   SMV-SAT (if you happen to work for Cadence).

2) If desired, adjust src/solvers/sat/satcheck.h to select which SAT
   solver to use (MiniSat2 with simplifier is the default).

3) Type cd src; make - that should do it.


COMPILATION ON MACOS X
----------------------

Follow these instructions:

0) You need a C/C++ compiler, Flex and Bison, and GNU make. To this
   end, install the XCode command line utilities (installing XCode is
   not enough). These are available at

   https://developer.apple.com/downloads/

1) You need a SAT solver (in source). We recommend MiniSat2. Do

   cd src
   make minisat2-download

   Alternatively, you may use zchaff, Booleforce, or
   SMV-SAT (if you happen to work for Cadence).

2) If desired, adjust src/solvers/sat/satcheck.h to select which SAT
   solver to use (MiniSat2 with simplifier is the default).

3) Type cd src; make - that should do it.


COMPILATION ON WINDOWS
----------------------

There are two options: compilation using g++ from Cygwin, or using
Visual Studio's compiler. As Cygwin has significant overhead during
process creation, we advise you use Visual Studio.

Follow these instructions:

0) You need a C/C++ compiler, Flex and Bison, GNU tar, gzip2,
   zlib, and GNU make. The GNU Make needs to be version 3.81 or higher. If
   you don't already have the above, we recommend you install Cygwin.

   WARNING: g++ 4.5.x has been observed to mis-optimize code in
   MiniSat with -O3. Use a different version (or -O1).

1) You need a SAT solver (in source). We recommend MiniSat2. Using a
   browser, download from

   http://minisat.se/downloads/minisat-2.2.0.tar.gz

   and then unpack with

   tar xfz minisat-2.2.0.tar.gz
   mv minisat minisat-2.2.0

   MiniSat2 relies on zlib, which you have to obtain for your environment.
   SMV-SAT (if you happen to work for Cadence).

2) Adjust src/config.inc for the paths to item 1).

3) If desired, adjust src/solvers/sat/satcheck.h to select which SAT
   solver to use (MiniSat2 with simplifier is the default).

4A) To compile with Cygwin, install the mingw compilers, and adjust
   the second line of config.inc to say

   BUILD_ENV = MinGW

4B) To compile with Visual Studio, make sure you have at least Visual
   Studio 10, and adjust the second line of config.inc to say

   BUILD_ENV = MSVC

   Open the Visual Studio Command prompt, and then run the bash.exe
   from Cygwin from in there.

5) Type cd src; make - that should do it.
