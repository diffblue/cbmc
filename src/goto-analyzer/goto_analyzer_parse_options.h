/// Goto-Analyser Command Line Option Processing
///
/// Goto-analyze is the tool front-end for CPROVER's classic style abstract
/// interpretation analyses.  By "classic style" I mean, domains are C++
/// objects, transformers are computed using C++ functions and the
/// fix-points are computed by iteration.  This is in contrast to 2LS's
/// approach where everything is computed using quantifier-elimination.
///
/// The analyses are mostly in analyses/ and although they are used in other
/// places in the code, the goal is that goto-analyze should eventually
/// provide an executable front-end for all of them.
///
/// There are a lot of different analyses and a lot of ways they can be
/// used.  Goto-analyze has six, largely independent, sets of options:
///
/// 1. Task : What you do once you've computed the domains.
/// 2. Abstract interpreter : What kind of abstract interpretation you do.
/// 3. History : What kind of steps and CFG sensitivity the interpreter uses.
/// 4. Domain : What domain you use to represent the values of the variables.
///             This includes domain specific configuration.
/// 5. Storage : How many history steps share domains.
/// 6. Output : What you do with the results.
///
/// Formally speaking, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are somewhat artificial distinction as they
/// are all really parts of the "what abstraction" question.
/// However they correspond to parts of our code architecture, so ...
/// they should stay.
///
/// Ideally, the cross product of options should be supported but ... in
/// practice there will always be ones that are not meaningful.  Those
/// should give errors.  In addition there are some analyses which are
/// currently stand alone as they don't fit directly in to this model.  For
/// example the unwind bounds analysis, which is both the task, the abstract
/// interpreter and the output.  Where possible these should be integrated /
/// support the other options.  In the case of the unwind analysis this
/// means the domain and it's sensitivity should be configurable.
///
///
/// Task
/// ----
///
/// Tasks are implemented by the relevant file in goto-analyze/static_*. At
/// the moment they are each responsible for building the domain / using the
/// other options.  As much as possible of this code should be shared.  Some
/// of these inherit from messaget.  They all probably should.
///
/// Show : Prints out the domains for inspection or further use.
///
/// Verify : Uses the domain to check all assertions in the code, marking
/// each one "SUCCESS" (the assertion always holds), "FAILURE if
/// reachable" (the assertion never holds), "UNKNOWN" (the assertion may or
/// may not hold).  This is implemented using domain_simplify().
///
/// Simplify : Generates a new goto program with branch conditions,
/// assertions, assumptions and assignments simplified using the information
/// in the domain (again using domain_simplify()).  This task is intended to
/// be used as a preprocessing step for other analysis.
///
/// Instrument : (Not implemented yet) Use the domains to add assume()
/// statements to the code giving invariants generated from the domain.
/// These assumes don't reduce the space of possible executions; they make
/// existing invariants explicit.  Again, intended as a preprocessing step.
///
///
/// Abstract Interpreter
/// --------------------
///
/// This option is effectively about how we compute the fix-point(s) /
/// which child class of ai_baset we use.  This and the other AI related
/// option categories (history, domain, storage, etc.) are more extensively
/// documented in analyses/ai.h and analyses/ai_*.h
///
///
/// Output
/// ------
///
/// Text, XML, JSON plus some others for specific domains such as dependence
/// graphs in DOT format.
