/// \file
/// Data structures and algorithms used by smt2_incremental_decision_proceduret
/// to track data about the objects which pointers point to. An object here
/// is the whole of an allocated block of memory. Objects in this sense have
/// no sub objects; only offsets. Valid examples of objects include -
///  * Primitives stored on the stack such as `int foo;`.
///  * Pointer primitives stored on the stack such as `int *sam;`.
///  * The entirety of a struct stored on the stack such as -
///    `struct bart{int eggs, int ham} bar;`
///  * The entirety of an array stored on the stack such as `int green[20];`
///  * The memory allocated by a malloc call - `malloc(20)`.
/// Examples of things / expressions which are not objects -
///  * A pointer to a primitive stored on the stack, such as `&foo` or `&sam`.
///    The value of these pointers encodes the combination of the unique object
///    identifier of `foo` / `sam` objects and a (zero) offset, but these
///    pointer values / memory addresses are not in themselves objects, although
///    the values may be stored in another object. This is a distinction between
///    values and the objects which contain them.
///  * A field within a struct, such as `bar.ham` from the previous example. A
///    pointer to this field is an offset into the base `bar` object.
///  * A pointer to element within an array, such as `&(green[5])`. A pointer to
///    an element in this example is an offset into the base `int green[20]`
///    object.
/// \note
/// The functionality in this file is intended to cover tracking objects and
/// their sizes only. It does not track anything to do with the offsets into
/// objects or the SMT encodings of objects / offsets / pointers.
