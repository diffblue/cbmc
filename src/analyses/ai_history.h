/// after exactly N iterations of this loop", "all traces that follow a
/// given pattern of branching to reach this point" or "all traces that have
/// the following call stack and reach this location".
///
/// These are used to control the abstract interpreter; edges are computed
/// per history.  Depending on what storage is used, they may also control
/// or influence the number of domains that are used, supporting delayed
/// merging, loop unwinding, context dependent analysis, etc.
