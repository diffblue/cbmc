// NOTES ON WINDOWS PIPES IMPLEMENTATION
//
// This is a note to explain the choices related to the Windows pipes
// implementation and to serve as information for future work on the
// Windows parts of this class.
//
// Windows supports two kinds of pipes: anonymous and named.
//
// Anonymous pipes can only operate in blocking mode. This is a problem for
// this class because blocking mode pipes (on Windows) will not allow the
// other end to read until the process providing the data has terminated.
// (You might think that this is not necessary, but in practice this is
// the case.) For example, if we ran
//    echo The Jabberwocky; ping 127.0.0.1 -n 6 >nul
// on the command line in Windows we would see the string "The Jabberwocky"
// immediately, and then the command would end about 6 seconds later after the
// pings complete. However, a blocking pipe will see nothing until the ping
// command has finished, even if the echo has completed and (supposedly)
// written to the pipe.
//
// For the above reason, we NEED to be able to use non-blocking pipes. Since
// anonymous pipes cannot be non-blocking (in theory they have a named pipe
// underneath, but it's not clear you could hack this to be non-blocking
// safely), we have to use named pipes.
//
// Named pipes can be non-blocking and this is how we create them.
//
// Aside on security:
// Named pipes can be connected to by other processes and here we have NOT
// gone deep into the security handling. The default used here is to allow
// access from the same session token/permissions. This SHOULD be sufficient
// for what we need.
//
// Non-blocking pipes allow immediate reading of any data on the pipe which
// matches the Linux/MacOS pipe behaviour and also allows reading of the
// string "The Jabberwocky" from the example above before waiting for the ping
// command to terminate. This reading can be done with any of the usual pipe
// read/peek functions, so we use those.
//
// There is one problem with the approach used here, that there is no Windows
// function that can wait on a non-blocking pipe. There are a few options that
// appear like they would work (or claim they work). Details on these and why
// they don't work are over-viewed here:
// -  WaitCommEvent claims it can wait for events on a handle (e.g. char
//    written) which would be perfect. Unfortunately on a non-blocking pipe
//    this returns immediately. Using this on a blocking pipe fails to detect
//    that a character is written until the other process terminates in the
//    example above, making this ineffective for what we want.
// -  Setting the pipe timeout or changing blocking after creation. This is
//    theoretically possible, but in practice either has no effect, or can
//    cause a segmentation fault. This was attempted with the SetCommTimeouts
//    function and cause segfault.
// -  Using a wait for event function (e.g. WaitForMultipleObjects, also single
//    object, event, etc.). These can in theory wait until an event, but have
//    the problem that with non-blocking pipes, the wait will not happen since
//    they return immediately. One might think they can work with a blocking
//    pipe and a timeout (i.e. have a blocking read and a timeout thread and
//    wait for one of them to happen to see if there is something to read or
//    whether we could timeout). However, while this can create the right
//    wait and timeout behaviour, since the underlying pipe is blocking this
//    means the example above cannot read "The Jabberwocky" until the ping has
//    finished, again undoing the interactive behaviour desired.
// Since none of the above work effectivley, the chosen approach is to use a
// non-blocking peek to see if there is anthing to read, and use a sleep and
// poll behaviour that might be much busier than we want. At the time of
// writing this has not been made smart, just a first choice option for how
// frequently to poll.
//
// Conclusion
// The implementation is written this way to mitigate the problems with what
// can and cannot be done with Windows pipes. It's not always pretty, but it
// does work and handles what we want.
