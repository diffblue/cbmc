/// Control granularity of object accesses
///
/// [Field sensitivity](\ref field_sensitivityt) is a transformation of the
/// instructions goto-program which mainly replaces some expressions by symbols
/// but can also add assignments to the target equations produced by symbolic
/// execution.
/// The main goal of this transformation is to allow more constants to be
/// propagated during symbolic execution.
/// Note that field sensitivity is not applied as a single pass over the
/// whole goto program but instead applied as the symbolic execution unfolds.
///
/// On a high level, field sensitivity replaces member operators with atomic
/// symbols representing a field when possible. In cases where this is not
/// immediately possible, like struct assignments, some things need to be added.
/// The possible cases are described below.
///
/// ### Member access
/// A member expression `struct_expr.field_name` is replaced by the
/// symbol `struct_expr..field_name`; note the use of `..` to visually
/// distinguish the symbol from the member expression. This is valid for
/// both lvalues and rvalues. See \ref field_sensitivityt::apply.
///
/// ### Symbols representing structs
/// In an rvalue, a symbol struct_expr which has a struct type with fields
/// field1, field2, etc, will be replaced by
/// `{struct_expr..field_name1; struct_expr..field_name2; â€¦}`.
/// See \ref field_sensitivityt::get_fields.
///
/// ### Assignment to a struct
/// When the symbol is on the left-hand-side, for instance for an assignment
/// `struct_expr = other_struct`, the assignment is replaced by a sequence
/// of assignments:
/// `struct_expr..field_name1 = other_struct..field_name1;`
/// `struct_expr..field_name2 = other_struct..field_name2;` etc.
/// See \ref field_sensitivityt::field_assignments.
