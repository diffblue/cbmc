Here a few minimalistic coding rules for the cprover source tree:

- Use 2 spaces indent, no tabs.
- No lines wider than 80 chars.
- If a method is bigger than a page, break it into parts.
- Put matching { } into the same column.
- Do not use namespaces.
- Prefer use of 'typedef' insted of 'using'.
- Prefer use of 'class' instead of 'struct'.
- User defined type identifiers have to be terminated by 't'. Moreover,
  before 't' may not be '_'.
- Avoid new/delete, use containers instead. In other words, do not perform
  heap operations directly.
- Write type modifiers before the type specifier.
- Do not use 'm_' prefix nor '_' suffix for names of attributes of structured
  types.
- Avoid destructive updates if possible. The irept has
  constant time copy.
- Avoid unnecessary #includes, especially in header files
- We allow to use 3rd libraries directly. No wrapper matching the coding rules
  is required. Allowed libraries are: C++ standard library.
- No "using namespace std;".
- Use instances of std::size_t for comparison with return values of .size() of
  SLT containers and algorithms, and use them as indices to arrays or vectors.
- Prohibited stuff from the standard library: ??? TODO!

Architecture-specific code:

- Avoid if possible.
- Use __LINUX__, __MACH__, and _WIN32 to distinguish the architectures.
- Don't include architecture-specific header files without #ifdef ...
