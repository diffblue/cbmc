#WHAT ARCHITECTURE?

CPROVER now needs a C++11 compliant compiler and is known to work in the
following environments:

- Linux
- MacOS X
- Windows

The above environments are currently tested as part of our continuous
integration system. It separately tests both the CMake build system and the
hand-written make files. The latest build steps being used in CI can be
[found here](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc/blob/develop/.github/workflows/pull-request-checks.yaml).

The environments below have been used successfully in the
past, but are not actively tested:

- Solaris 11
- FreeBSD 11

#Building using CMake

Building with CMake is supported across Linux, MacOS X and Windows with Visual
Studio 2019. There are also hand-written make files which can be used to build
separate targets independently. Usage of the hand-written make files is
explained in a separate section. The CMake build can build the complete
repository in fewer steps and supports better integration with various IDEs and
static-analysis tools. On Windows, the CMake build has the advantage of not
depending on Cygwin or MinGW, and doesn't require manual modification of build
files.

1. Ensure you have all the build dependencies installed. Build dependencies are
   the same as for the makefile build, but with the addition of CMake version
   3.2 or higher. The installed CMake version can be queried with `cmake
   --version`. To install CMake:
   - On Debian-like distributions, do
     ```
     apt-get install g++ gcc flex bison make git curl patch cmake
     ```
   - On Red Hat/Fedora or derivates, do
     ```
     dnf install gcc gcc-c++ flex bison curl patch cmake
     ```
   - On macOS, do
     ```
     xcode-select --install
     ```
     You should also install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), after which you can
     run `brew install cmake` to install CMake.
   - On Windows, ensure you have Visual Studio 2019 or later installed. The
     developer command line that comes with Visual Studio 2019 has CMake
     already available. You will also need to ensure that you have winflexbison
     installed and available in the path. winflexbison is available from
     [the github release page](https://github.com/lexxmark/winflexbison/releases/)
     or through
     [the chocolatey package manager.](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/winflexbison3)
     Installing `strawberryperl` is advised if you want to run tests on Windows.
     This is available from
     [the Strawberry Perl website](https://strawberryperl.com/) or through the
     [the chocolatey package manager.](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/StrawberryPerl)
   - Use of CMake has not been tested on Solaris or FreeBSD. However, it should
     be possible to install CMake from the system package manager or the
     [official download page](https://cmake.org/download) on those systems.
     The dependencies (as listed in the relevant sections above) will also be
     required, and should be installed using the suggested methods.
2. Navigate to the *top level* folder of the project. This is different from
   the Makefile build, which requires you to navigate to the `src` directory
   first.
3. Update git submodules:
   ```
   git submodule update --init
   ```
4. Generate build files with CMake:
   ```
   cmake -S . -Bbuild
   ```
   This command tells CMake to use the configuration in the current directory,
   and to generate build files into the `build` directory.  This is the point
   to specify custom build settings, such as compilers and build back-ends. You
   can use clang (for example) by adding the argument
   `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++` to the command line. You can also tell CMake
   to generate IDE projects by supplying the `-G` flag.  Run `cmake -G` for a
   comprehensive list of supported back-ends.

   On macOS >10.14, the build will fail unless you explicitly specify
   the full path to the compiler. This issue is being tracked
   [here](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc/issues/4956). The invocation thus
   looks like this:
   ```
   cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang
   ```

   Generally it is not necessary to manually specify individual compiler or
   linker flags, as CMake defines a number of "build modes" including Debug and
   Release modes. To build in a particular mode, add the flag
   `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` (or `RelWithDebInfo`) to the initial invocation.
   The default is to perform an optimized build via the `Release` configuration.

   If you *do* need to manually add flags, use `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=...` and
   `-DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=...`. This is useful for enabling clang's
   sanitizers.

   **Note: Building without JBMC**: On platforms where installing the Java
   Development Kit and Maven is difficult, you can avoid needing these
   dependencies by not building JBMC. Just pass `-DWITH_JBMC=OFF` to `cmake`.

   Finally, to enable building universal binaries on macOS, you can pass the
   flag `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=i386;x86_64`. If you don't supply this flag,
   the built binaries will only work on the architecture of the machine being
   used to do the build.

5. Run the build:
   ```
   cmake --build build
   ```
   This command tells CMake to invoke the correct tool to run the build in the
   `build` directory. You can also use the build back-end directly by invoking
   `make`, `ninja`, or opening the generated IDE project as appropriate. The
   complete set of built binaries can be found in `build/bin/` once the build
   is complete.

   *Parallel building*: You can pass `-j<numjobs>` to `make` to indicate how many
   jobs to run simultaneously. `ninja` defaults to building with `# of cores + 2`
   jobs at the same time.

#Building using Make

The rest of this section is split up based on the platform being built on.
Please read the section appropriate for your platform.

## Compiling with Make on Linux

We assume that you have a Debian/Ubuntu or Red Hat-like distribution.

1. You need a C/C++ compiler, Flex and Bison, and GNU make.
   The GNU Make needs to be version 3.81 or higher.
   On Debian-like distributions, do as root:
   ```
   apt-get install g++ gcc flex bison make git curl patch
   ```
   On Red Hat/Fedora or derivates, do as root:
   ```
   dnf install gcc gcc-c++ flex bison curl patch
   ```
   Note that you need g++ version 5.0 or newer.

   On Amazon Linux and similar distributions, do as root:
   ```
   yum install gcc72-c++ flex bison curl patch tar
   ```

   To compile JBMC, you additionally need the JDK and Maven 3. You also
   need jq if you wish to run the entire test suite.
   On Debian-like distributions, do as root:
   ```
   apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk maven jq
   ```
   On Red Hat/Fedora or derivates, do as root:
   ```
   dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel maven jq
   ```

2. As a user, get the CBMC source via
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc cbmc-git
   cd cbmc-git
   ```

3. To compile, do
   ```
   make -C src minisat2-download
   make -C src
   ```
   See doc/architectural/compilation-and-development.md for instructions on how
   to use a SAT solver other than MiniSat 2.

4. To compile JBMC, do
   ```
   make -C jbmc/src setup-submodules
   make -C jbmc/src
   ```

## Compiling with Make on MacOS

Follow these instructions:

1. You need a C/C++ compiler, Flex and Bison, and GNU make. To this end, first
   install the XCode from the App-store and then type
   ```
   xcode-select --install
   ```
   in a terminal window.
2. Then get the CBMC source via
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc cbmc-git
   cd cbmc-git
   ```
3. To compile CBMC, do
   ```
   make -C src minisat2-download
   make -C src
   ```
4. To compile JBMC, you additionally need Maven 3, which has to be installed
   manually. Then do
   ```
   make -C jbmc/src setup-submodules
   make -C jbmc/src
   ```

## Compiling with Make on Solaris

We assume Solaris 11.4 or newer.  To build JBMC, you'll need to install
Maven 3 manually.

1. As root, get the necessary development tools:
   ```
   pkg install gcc-c++-7 bison flex
   ```
2. As a user, get the CBMC source via
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc cbmc-git
   cd cbmc-git
   ```
3. To compile CBMC, type
   ```
   gmake -C src minisat2-download DOWNLOADER=wget TAR=gtar
   gmake -C src
   ```
4. To compile JBMC, type
   ```
   gmake -C jbmc/src setup-submodules
   gmake -C jbmc/src
   ```

## Compiling with Make on FreeBSD

1. As root, get the necessary tools:
   ```
   pkg install bash gmake git www/p5-libwww patch flex bison
   ```
   To compile JBMC, additionally install
   ```
   pkg install openjdk8 wget maven3
   ```
2. As a user, get the CBMC source via
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc cbmc-git
   cd cbmc-git
   ```
3. To compile CBMC, do
   ```
   gmake -C src minisat2-download
   gmake -C src
   ```
4. To compile JBMC, do
   ```
   gmake -C jbmc/src setup-submodules
   gmake -C jbmc/src
   ```

#Working with IDEs and Docker

## Working with Visual Studio on Windows

Follow these instructions to work on Windows with Visual Studio:

1. Open the `cbmc` folder in Visual Studio. Visual Studio 2017 and
   later have automated support for CMake projects, so you need to
   give sometime to Visual Studio to index the project and load its
   own plugins, and then it's going to be ready to build `cbmc`.
2. Once indexing and plugin loading has finished, a menu `Build`
   should have appeared on the top bar. From there, select `Build All`.
3. After the build has finished, there should be a folder `out` present.
   Navigating `out/build/<build_parameters>/bin` should get you to the
   binaries and other artifacts built, with `<build_parameters>` corresponding
   to something like `x64-Debug (Default)` or whatever the equivalent is
   for your system.

The above instructions have been tested against Visual Studio 2019.

## Working with Eclipse

To work with Eclipse, do the following:

1. Select File -> New -> Makefile Project with Existing Code
2. Type "cprover" as "Project Name"
3. Select the "src" subdirectory as "Existing Code Location"
4. Select a toolchain appropriate for your platform
5. Click "Finish"
6. Select Project -> Build All

You can also select the repository's root folder as the "Existing Code 
Location". This has the advantage that you can build both CBMC and JBMC without
the need to integrate JBMC as a separate project. Be aware that you need to 
change the build location (Select project in Eclipse -> Properties -> C/C++ 
Build) to one of the src directories.

## Working with Docker

To compile and run the tools in a Docker container, do the following:

1. From the root folder of the project, run `$ docker build -t cbmc .`
2. After the building phase has finished, there should be a new
   image with the CProver binaries installed under `/usr/local/bin/`.

   To start a container using that image as a base, run `$ docker run -i -t cbmc`
   This will result in dropping you to a new terminal inside the container. To
   load files for analysis into the container, one way is by mounting the folder
   that contains the tests to the container. A possible invocation that does that
   is: `$ docker run --mount type=bind,source=local/path/with/files,target=/mnt/analysis -i t cbmc`.
   In the resulting container, the files present in the local file system under
   `local/path/with/files` will be present under `/mnt/analysis`.

#Compilation options and configuration

## Compiling with CUDD

Cudd is a BDD library which can be used instead of the builtin miniBDD
implementation.

If compiling with make:

1. Download and compile Cudd:
   ```
   make -C src cudd-download
   ```
2. Uncomment the definition of `CUDD` in the file `src/config.inc`.
3. Compile with `make -C src`

If compiling with CMake:

1. Add the `-DCMAKE_USE_CUDD=true` flag to the `cmake` configuration phase.
   For instance:
   ```
   cmake -S . -Bbuild -DCMAKE_USE_CUDD=true
   ```
2. Run the build:
   ```
   cmake --build build
   ```

## Use BDDs for guards

There are two implementation for symex guards. The default one uses the
internal representation of expression. The other one uses BDDs and
though experimental, it is expected to have better performance,
in particular when used in conjunction with CUDD.

To use the BDD implementation of guards, add the `BDD_GUARDS`
compilation flag:
  * If compiling with make:
    ```
    make -C src CXXFLAGS="-O2 -DBDD_GUARDS"
    ```
  * If compiling with CMake:
    ```
    cmake -S . -Bbuild -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-DBDD_GUARDS"
    ```
    and then `cmake --build build`

## Compiling with alternative SAT solvers

For the packaged builds of CBMC on our release page we currently build CBMC
with the MiniSat2 SAT solver statically linked at compile time. However it is
also possible to build CBMC using alternative SAT solvers.

### Compiling CBMC Using Solver Native Interfaces

The following solvers are supported by CBMC using custom interfaces and can
by downloaded and compiled by the build process: MiniSAT2, CaDiCaL, and Glucose.

For `make` alternatives to the default (i.e. not MiniSAT) can be built with the
following commands for CaDiCaL:
```
make -C src cadical-download
make -C src CADICAL=../../cadical
```
and for glucose
```
make -C src glucose-download
make -C src GLUCOSE=../../glucose-syrup
```

For CMake the alternatives can be built with the following arguments to `cmake`
for CaDiCaL `-Dsat_impl=cadical` and for glucose `-Dsat_impl=glucose`.


### Compiling with IPASIR Interface

The below compiling instructions allow linking of an arbitrary IPASIR
compatible SAT solver when compiling CBMC.

The general command using `make` is to compile with
```
make -C src LIBS="$PWD/SATOBJ SATLINKFLAGS" IPASIR=$PWD/SATPATH
```
Where `SATOBJ` is the pre-compiled IPASIR compatible SAT binary,
`SATLINKFLAGS` are any flags required by the SAT object file, and
`SATPATH` is the path to the SAT interface.

The rest of this section provides detailed instructions for some example
SAT solvers.

#### Compiling with CaDiCaL via IPASIR

Note that CaDiCaL can also be built using CBMC's CaDiCaL native interface
as described above. This section is to use CaDiCaL with the IPASIR
interface in CBMC.

The [CaDiCaL](https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical) solver supports the
[IPASIR](https://github.com/biotomas/ipasir) C interface to incremental SAT
solvers, which is also supported by CBMC. So the process for producing a CBMC
with CaDiCaL build is to build CaDiCaL as a static library then compile CBMC
with the IPASIR build options and link to the CaDiCaL static library.

Note that at the time of writing this has been tested to work with the CaDiCaL
1.4.0 on Ubuntu 18.04 & 20.04 and MacOS.

1. Download CaDiCaL:
   ```
   git clone --branch rel-1.4.0 https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical.git
   ```
   This will clone the CaDiCaL repository into a `cadical` subdirectory and
   checkout release 1.4.0, which has been checked for compatibility with CBMC at
   the time these instructions were written.

2. Build CaDiCaL:
   ```
   cd cadical
   ./configure
   make cadical
   cd ..
   ```
   This will create a build directory called `build` inside the clone of the
   CaDiCaL repository. The `cadical` make target is specified in this example in
   order to avoid building targets which are not required by CBMC. The built
   static library will be placed in `cadical/build/libcadical.a`.

3. Build CBMC:
   ```
   make -C src LIBS="$PWD/cadical/build/libcadical.a" IPASIR=$PWD/cadical/src
   ```
   This links the CaDiCaL library as part of the build. Passing the IPASIR
   parameter tells the build system to build for the IPASIR interface. The
   argument for the IPASIR parameter gives the build system the location for
   the IPASIR headers, which is needed for the cbmc includes of `ipasir.h`. The
   compiled binary will be placed in `cbmc/src/cbmc/cbmc`.

---

It's also possible to build CBMC using CaDiCaL through IPASIR via `cmake`,
controlled with the flag `-Dsat_impl=ipasir-cadical`, like so:

```sh
$ cmake -Bbuild_ipasir -S. -Dsat_impl=ipasir-cadical
```

An advanced user may also take a more adventurous route, trying to link
CBMC against any solver supporthing the IPASIR interface. To do that,
an invocation like this is needed:

```sh
$ cmake -Bbuild_ipasir -S . -Dsat_impl=ipasir-custom -DIPASIR=<source_location> -DIPASIR_LIB=<lib_location>
```

with `<source_location>` being the absolute path to the folder containing
the solver implementation and `<lib_location>` being the absolute path that
contains a precompiled static library of the solver (`.a` file).

#### Compiling with Riss via IPASIR

The [Riss](https://github.com/conp-solutions/riss) solver supports the
[IPASIR](https://github.com/biotomas/ipasir) C interface to incremental SAT
solvers, which is also supported by CBMC. So the process for producing a CBMC
with Riss build is to build Riss as a static library then compile CBMC with the
IPASIR build options and link to the Riss static library. The following
instructions have been confirmed to work on Ubuntu 20 at the time of writing.
They can also be made to work on Ubuntu 18, by using a debug build of Riss. Riss
uses Linux specific functionality / API calls. Therefore it can't be compiled
successfully on Windows or macOS.

1. Download Riss:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/conp-solutions/riss riss
   ```
   This will clone the Riss repository into a `riss` subdirectory.

2. Build Riss:
   ```
   cd riss
   cmake -H. -Brelease -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   cd release
   make riss-coprocessor-lib-static
   cd ../..
   ```
   This will create a build directory called `release` inside the clone of the
   Riss repository and build the static library in
   `riss/release/lib/libriss-coprocessor.a`.

3. Build CBMC:
   ```
   make -C src LIBS="$PWD/riss/release/lib/libriss-coprocessor.a -lpthread" IPASIR=$PWD/riss/riss
   ```
   This links the Riss library and the pthreads library. The pthreads library is
   needed because the Riss library uses it for multithreading. Passing the
   IPASIR parameter tells the build system to build for the IPASIR interface.
   The argument for the IPASIR parameter gives the build system the location for
   the IPASIR headers, which is needed for the cbmc includes of `ipasir.h`. The
   compiled binary will be placed in `cbmc/src/cbmc/cbmc`.
This document assumes you have already been able to build CPROVER on
your chosen architecture.

#RUNNING REGRESSION AND UNIT TESTS

Regression and unit tests can be run using cmake or make. Your choice here
should be the same as the compiling of the project itself.

Note that running all regression and unit tests can be slow when a debug
build of CPROVER is used.

## CMAKE

This can be done by changing to the directory you built the
project in with cmake and running ctest as follows.
```
cd <build_dir>
ctest . -V -L CORE
```
You can also specify a pattern of tests to run as follows.
```
ctest . -V -L CORE -R <pattern>
```
For example
```
ctest . -V -L CORE -R goto
```
that will run all CORE tests that include `goto` in their
name.

## MAKE

The regression and unit tests are handled differently in the
make system. To run the regressions tests change to the
`regression` directory and simply running make as follows.
```
cd regression
make test
```
To run the unit tests, change into the `unit` directory and
then run make as follows.
```
cd unit
make test
```
