This is testing the construct "something->field . some_method()"
That requires a null check against "something" (for the deref to read 'field')
and another one against "something->field" (for the instance method call).
If they're made in the correct order (check "something" first) then one of the
null checks cannot fail in this particular scenario; if they're made in the
wrong order ("something->field" first) then they can both fail.
