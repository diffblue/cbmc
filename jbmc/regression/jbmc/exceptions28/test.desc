This test verifies that we can handle the exception table not being ordered
test.main gives the following exception table:
 from    to  target type
    0     6    15   Class MyException
    7    15    15   Class MyException
    0     6    18   Class java/lang/Exception
    7    15    18   Class java/lang/Exception
This is not ordered in the sense that the two handlers for the block 0-6 are not next to each other.
