VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL

reference is null in .*: FAILURE

This checks that the second use of a particular exception type in a given function is correctly initialised.
In the failing case the #exception_value variable is nondet at the time it is thrown, so cbmc can set it to null and fail an assertion.
