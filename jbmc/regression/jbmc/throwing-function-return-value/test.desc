This checks that when a function may throw, we can nonetheless constant-propagate
and populate the value-set for the normal-return path. In particular we don't
expect to see any reference to a zero-generation return value (indicating
reading the return-value when not defined), nor do we expect to see any code
from the Sub class, which is not accessible and can only be reached when
constant propagation has lost information to the point we're not sure which type
virtual calls against Test may find.
The final check ensures there is no uncertainty about whether Test.g() may throw,
which would result in a nondet return-value (corresponding to the hypothetical
throwing path).
