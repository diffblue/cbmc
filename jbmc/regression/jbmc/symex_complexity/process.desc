This tests that the complexity limits apply correctly and that each level of them are detected correctly:

Branch cancelling.
Loop cancelling.
Loop blacklisting.

When these don't work this test may take some time to run (and then fail), which is hard to
restrict because this is the problem this feature is meant to solve. If this test is running
slowly, high chance something has gone wrong.
