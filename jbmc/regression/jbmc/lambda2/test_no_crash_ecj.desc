VERIFICATION FAILED

Tests that it doesn't crash when failing to read a `BootstrapMethods` entry and
there is another attribute after this. The EXIT=10/VERIFCATION FAILED comes from
the fact that the invokedynamic currently returns a null object, causing our
model of this to predict a null pointer exception. This test will need to be
adjusted when lambdas work.
