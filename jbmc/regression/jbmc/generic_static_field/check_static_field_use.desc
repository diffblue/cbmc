This checks that the return value type matches the static field -- if it didn't,
either --validate-goto-model would throw because of a mismatching assignment (checked
in ensure_runs.desc), or a cast would be used to adjust the type.

The original motivation for this test was that generic field references could
accidentally omit generic arguments that were present in function types.
