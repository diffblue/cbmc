For some reason symex assigns 'g' to zero, even though
the only viable assignment should be one.
This issue seems to only occur when a variable is
assigned inside the local scope of a thread-block.

If instead, we call a function from inside the thread-block and
then assign  'g' to 1 then as expected the only viable
assignment to 'g' is 1 (see test4.desc)
