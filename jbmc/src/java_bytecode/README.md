\subsection java-bytecode-lowering-to-goto Lowering to GOTO

The Java language contains high-level programming concepts like virtual
functions and throw/catch semantics. These need to be rewritten in terms of
other, more fundamental operations in order to analyse the Java program. This
operation is referred to as "lowering". See Background Concepts for more
information.

The following lowering operations are done on Java bytecode after converting
into a basic `codet` representation.

- \ref java-bytecode-runtime-exceptions "Add runtime exceptions"
- \ref java-bytecode-remove-java-new "Remove `new` calls"
- \ref java-bytecode-remove-exceptions "Remove thrown exceptions"
- \ref java-bytecode-remove-instanceof
- As well as other non-Java specific transformations (see \ref goto-programs for
    details on these)

These are performed in `process_goto_function` for example
\ref jbmc_parse_optionst::process_goto_function

Once these lowerings have been completed, you have a GOTO model that can be handled by \ref goto-symex.

\subsection java-bytecode-pointer-type-selection Pointer type selection

In Java, all variables that are of a non-primitive type are pointers to
an object. When initializing such variables using \ref java_object_factoryt,
e.g., as input arguments for the method under test, we may need to select the
correct pointer type. For example, abstract classes can be replaced with their
concrete implementations and type parameters in generic types can be replaced
with their specialized types.

The class \ref select_pointer_typet offers the basic interface for this
functionality, in particular see
\ref select_pointer_typet::convert_pointer_type. Note that this class only
implements generic specialization (see \ref
java-bytecode-generic-specialization), derived classes can override this
behavior to provide more sophisticated type selection.

\subsection java-bytecode-generic-specialization Generic specialization

In Java, generics are checked at compile-time for type-correctness. The generic
type information is then removed in a process called type erasure. However,
throwing away all this type information would be very inconvenient for our
analysis. Therefore, when we initialize variables that have generic type we
dynamically replace the generic parameters with their specialized types rather
than using only the raw type. For example, consider a generic class
`MyGeneric<T>` with a field `T myField`. When initializing a variable
`MyGeneric<Integer> mg` we change the type of its field `mg.myField` from
`MyGeneric::T` to `Integer`. Generic specialization is applied during pointer
type selection (see \ref java-bytecode-pointer-type-selection).

The generic specialization relies on a map that stores the concrete types of all
generic parameters in the current scope. The map is maintained in \ref
java_object_factoryt::generic_parameter_specialization_map. Note that not all
generic parameters need to have a concrete type, e.g., when the method under
test is generic. The types are removed from the map when the scope changes. In
different depths of the scope the parameters can be specialized with different
types so we keep a stack of types for each parameter.

We use the map in \ref select_pointer_typet::specialize_generics to
retrieve the concrete type of generic parameters such as `MyGeneric::T` and of
arrays of generic parameters such as `MyGeneric::T[]`. More complicated
generic types such as `MyGeneric<T>` are specialized indirectly within \ref
java_object_factoryt. Their concrete types are already stored in the map and are
retrieved when needed, e.g., to initialize their fields.

\section java-bytecode-parsing Java bytecode parsing (parser, convert_class, convert_method)

To be documented.

\subsection java-class-section How a java program / class is represented in a .class

Every Java class is compiled into a .class file. Inner classes, anonymous
classes or classes for tableswitches are also compiled into their own .class
files.

There exists an [official
specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html)

Each class files contains information about its version, the constant pool,
information about the contained class, its super-class, its implemented
interfaces, its fields, methods and finally additional attributes, such as
information about lambda functions used in the methods of the class or inner
classes the it contains.

The content of a .class file can be inspected via the `javap` tool which is part
of the JDK installation. Useful options are `-c` for code, `-p` to display
protected / private methods `-l` for line numbers and local variable
information, as well as `-verbose` which prints a lot of additional information.

In general, all variable length entries in a class file are represented by first
having an integer `n` that specifies the number of entries and then an array of
`n` such entries in the file. All variable length attribute also contain
information about their length in bytes.

The integer format used in class files are unsigned integers of size 8/16/32
bit, which are named as `u1`/`u2`/`u4`.

\subsection java-class-access-flags Access Flags

The JVM specification defines different access flags, e.g., `final`, `static`,
`protected`, `private` etc. where different ones are applicable to the class
itself, its fields or methods. All access flags are represented as bits, the set
of bits that are defined for one entity is represented as disjunction of those
values. Each of these values is defined as a constant with a name prefixed with
`ACC_` in JBMC, e.g., as
@code
#define ACC_PUBLIC 0x0001
#define ACC_ENUM 0x4000
@endcode

\subsection java-class-constant-pool Constant Pool

The constant pool contains all strings and referred values that are used in the
.class. This includes the names of the class itself and its super-class, as well
as the names and signatures of all fields and methods. All strings in the
constant pool are in UTF-16 format.

\subsection java-class-fields Fields

Each member variable of a class has a field entry with a corresponding field
information structure. This contains the name of the field, its raw JVM type
(called the descriptor) and an optional signature.

A signature is an extension to the Java raw types and contains information about
the generic type of an object if applicable.

The name of the field, the descriptor and the signature are all represented as
indices into the constant pool of the class file.

\subsection java-class-methods Methods

Methods are represented in a similar way as fields. Each method has an
associated name, descriptor and optional signature entry in the constant pool
table.

An implemented method also has several attributes. One is the `Code` attribute
that stores the actual bytecode instructions. There is also an optional
`LocalVariableTable` which contains the names of local variables and
parameters. In addition to this there is also an optional
`LocalVariableTypeTable` that contains information about generic local variables
and parameters. Finally the exception table is defined as entries in the
`Exceptions` attribute.

Note: most information about generic types is optional and exists mainly as
debugger information. This is because the Java compiler ensures that typing is
correct and creates code accordingly. The same holds true for information on
local variables. It is therefore advisable to compile Java projects with the
`-g` option that adds debugging information in all cases.

\subsection java-class-attributes Attributes

The last section contains additional attributes, e.g., `SourceFile` which
specified from which source file the .class was compiled, `BootstrapMethods`
which is used for lambda functions or `InnerClasses` which refers to inner
classes of the class in question.


\section java-bytecode-runtime-exceptions Adding runtime exceptions (java_bytecode_instrument)

To be documented.

\section java-bytecode-concurrency-instrumentation Concurrency instrumentation

Relevant code:

  - \ref java_bytecode_concurrency_instrumentation.h
  - \ref java_bytecode_concurrency_instrumentation.cpp
  - \ref java_static_initializers.h
  - \ref java_static_initializers.cpp
  - \ref java_bytecode_convert_method.cpp

Concurrency instrumentation for Java programs is disabled by default. It can
be enabled by specifying the `--java-threading` command line flag.

Thread-blocks have special semantics, in the sense that unlike basic blocks
they can be executed independently.  JBMC treats a sequence of codet's
surrounded with calls to `CProver.startThread:(I)V` and `CProver.endThread:(I)V` as
a thread-block. These functions take one argument, an integer, that is used to
associate the start of a thread (i.e: calls to `CProver.startThread:(I)V`) to the
end of the thread (i.e: calls to `CProver.endThread:(I)V`). JBMC assumes that
calls to the these functions are well-formed, more specifically, each call to
`CProver.startThread:(I)V` must have an associated call to `CProver.endThread:(I)V`.

The instrumentation process (described here) will transform the aforementioned
function calls, synchronized blocks/methods and calls to
`java.lang.Thread.getCurrentThreadId:()I` into appropriate codet. As part of
this process a new variable per thread  is created  along with a single global
variable that is used keep track of thread identifiers. These
variables are needed to handle calls to
`java.lang.Thread.getCurrentThreadId:()I`.

Hold on, how do we go from Java threads to `CProver.startThread:(I)V` and
`CProver.endThread:(I)V`? Well, two ways

  - You are free to use the CProver API and manually and insert calls to the
    `CProver.startThread:(I)V` and `CProver.endThread:(I)V`.
  - Models! Which provide a mock implementation of the `java.lang.Thread`
    class.

Note: instrumentation of Java static initializers changes when the
`--java-threading` flag is specified, this is because the static initializer of
every class needs to be carefully synchronized to prevent superfluous
interleavings.

Note': conversation of synchronized methods (`void synchronized test(){ ... }`) and
synchronized blocks (`synchronized(lock) { ... }`) are dealt with differently as
they are represented differently in bytecode. One is a flag, while the other
has explicit instructions.

\subsection converting-thread-blocks Converting Thread Blocks

JBMC will iterate through the symbol table to find and instrument
thread-blocks.  Specifically, function calls to `CProver.startThread:(I)V` are
transformed into a `codet(id=ID_start_thread, destination=I)`, which carries a target label in
the field `destination`. Similarly `CProver.endThread(I)V` is transformed into
a `codet(id=ID_end_thread)`.

For each new thread a thread local variable `__CPROVER__thread_id` is created.
The new id is obtained by incrementing a global variable
`__CPROVER__next_thread_id`.

The semantics of `codet(id=ID_start_thread, destination=I)` roughly corresponds to: spawn the
current thread, continue the execution of the current thread in the next line,
and continue the execution of the new thread at the destination.

Example, the following Java code:

```java
    CProver.startThread(333);
    ...  // thread body
    CProver.endThread(333);
```

is transformed into the following codet:

```C
  codet(id=ID_start_thread, destination=__CPROVER_THREAD_ENTRY_333)
  codet(id=ID_goto, destination=__CPROVER_THREAD_EXIT_333)
  codet(id=ID_label, label=__CPROVER_THREAD_ENTRY_333)
  codet(id=ID_atomic_begin)
  __CPROVER__next_thread_id += 1;
  __CPROVER__thread_id = __CPROVER__next_thread_id;
  ... // thread body
  codet(id=ID_end_thread)
  codet(id=ID_label, label=__CPROVER_THREAD_EXIT_333)
```

The ID of the thread is made accessible to the Java program by having calls
to the function `CProver.getCurrentThreadId()I` replaced by the variable
`__CPROVER__thread_id`.

Example, the following Java code:

```java
  int g = java.lang.thead.getCurrentThreadId();
```

is transformed into the following codet:

```C
  code_assignt(lhs=g, rhs=__CPROVER__thread_id)
```

\subsection converting-synchronized-blocks Converting Synchronized Blocks

Synchronized blocks make it impossible for two synchronized blocks on the same
object to interleave.

Converting synchronized blocks is rather straightforward as there is a specific
bytecode instruction to indicate the start (`monitorenter`) and end (`monitorexit`)
of a synchronized block.

`monitorenter` is converted to a call to
`java::java.lang.Object.monitorenter:(Ljava/lang/Object;)V`.

`monitorexit` is converted to a call to
`java::java.lang.Object.monitorexit:(Ljava/lang/Object;)V`.

\subsection converting-synchronized-methods Converting Synchronized Methods

Synchronized methods make it impossible for two invocations of the same method
on the same object to interleave.

A method is considered to be synchronized and thus subject to the following
process, if the symbol that represents it has the irep_id `is_synchronized`
specified. In Java this corresponds to the `synchronized` keyword in the
declaration of a method.

Unlike synchronized blocks Java synchronized methods do not have explicit calls
to the instructions `monitorenter` and `monitorexit` (or equivalents), instead
the JVM interprets the synchronized flag  and internally implements
locking/unlocking on the object.

To emulate this behaviour JBMC will iterate through the symbol table to find
synchronized methods. It will then  insert a call to our model of `monitorenter`
(`java::java.lang.Object.monitorenter:(Ljava/lang/Object;)V`) at the beginning
of the method and calls to our model of `monitorexit`
(`java::java.lang.Object.monitorexit:(Ljava/lang/Object;)V`) is instrumented at
each return instruction.  We wrap the entire body of the method with an
exception handler that will call our model of `monitorexit` if the method returns
exceptionally.

Example, the following Java code:

```java
synchronized int amethod(int p)
 {
   int x = 0;
   if(p == 0)
     return -1;
   x = p / 10
   return x
 }
```

The codet version of the above is too verbose be shown here. Instead the following code depicts
our equivalent Java code interpretation of the above:

```java
int amethod(int p)
{
 try
 {
   java::java.lang.Object.monitorenter(this);
   int x = 0;
   if(p == 0)
   {
     java::java.lang.Object.monitorexit(this);
     return -1;
   }
   java::java.lang.Object.monitorexit(this);
   return x
 }
 catch(java::java.lang.Throwable e)
 {
   // catch every exception, including errors!
   java::java.lang.Object.monitorexit(this);
   throw e;
 }
}
```

\section java-bytecode-remove-java-new Remove `new`, `newarray` and `multianewarray` bytecode operators

\ref remove_java_new.h is responsible for converting the `new`, `newarray` and
`multianewarray` Java bytecode operation into \ref codet. Specifically it
converts the bytecode instruction into:  - An ALLOCATE with the size of the
object being created  - An assignment to the value zeroing its contents  - If an
array, initializing the size and data components  - If a multi-dimensional
array, recursively calling `java_new` on each sub array

An ALLOCATE is a \ref side_effect_exprt that is interpreted by \ref
goto_symext::symex_allocate

_Note: it does not call the constructor as this is done by a separate
java_bytecode operation._

\subsection java_objects Java Objects (`new`)

The basic `new` operation is represented in Java bytecode by the `new` op

These are converted by \ref remove_java_newt::lower_java_new

For example, the following Java code:

```java
TestClass f = new TestClass();
```

Which is represented as the following Java bytecode:

```
0: new           #2                  // class TestClass
3: dup
4: invokespecial #3                  // Method "<init>":()V
```

The first instruction only is translated into the following `codet`s:

```cpp
tmp_object1 = side_effect_exprt(ALLOCATE, sizeof(TestClass))
*tmp_object1 = struct_exprt{.component = 0, ... }
```

For more details about the zero expression see \ref expr_initializert

\subsection oned_arrays Single Dimensional Arrays (`newarray`)

The new Java array operation is represented in Java bytecode by the `newarray`
operation.

These are converted by \ref remove_java_newt::lower_java_new_array

See \ref java-bytecode-array-representation for details on how arrays are
represented in codet.

A `newarray` is represented as:
 - an allocation of the array object (the same as with a regular Java object).
 - Initialize the size component
 - Initialize the data component

For example the following Java:

```java
TestClass[] tArray = new TestClass[5];
```

Which is compiled into the following Java bytecode:

```
8: iconst_5
9: anewarray     #2                  // class TestClass
```

Is translated into the following `codet`s:

```cpp
tmp_object1 = side_effect_exprt(ALLOCATE, sizeof(java::array[referenence]))
*tmp_object1 = struct_exprt{.size = 0, .data = null}
tmp_object1->length = length
tmp_new_data_array1 = side_effect_exprt(java_new_array_data, TestClass)
tmp_object1->data = tmp_new_data_array1
ARRAY_SET(tmp_new_data_array1, NULL)
```

The `ARRAY_SET` `codet` sets all the values to null.

\subsection multidarrays Multi Dimensional Arrays (`newmultiarray`)

The new Java multi dimensional array operation is represented in bytecode by
`multianewarray`

These are also by \ref remove_java_newt::lower_java_new_array

They work the same as single dimensional arrays but create a for loop for each
element in the array since these start initialized.

```cpp
for(tmp_index = 0; tmp_index < dim_size; ++tmp_index)
{
  struct java::array[reference] *subarray_init;
  subarray_init = java_new_array
  newarray_tmp1->data[tmp_index] = (void *)subarray_init;
}
```

`remove_java_new` is then recursively applied to the new `subarray`.

\section java-bytecode-remove-exceptions Remove exceptions

When \ref remove_exceptions is called on the \ref goto_modelt, the
goto model contains complex instructions (\ref goto_program_instruction_typet)
such as `CATCH-POP`, `CATCH-PUSH` and `THROW`. In order to analyze the goto
model, the instructions must be simplified to use more basic instructions - this
is called "lowering". This class lowers the `CATCH` and `THROW` instructions.

`THROW` instructions are replaced by assigning to `@inflight_exception` and a
goto to end of the function. `CATCH` instructions are replaced by a check of
the `@inflight_exception` and setting it to null.

\subsection throw THROW

Consider a simple method `testException(I)V`:

```java
public class TestExceptions {
    int field;
    public void testException(int i) throws Exception {
        if (i < 0) {
            throw new Exception();
        }
        field = i;
    }
}
```

The goto for `testException(I)V` before `remove_exceptions` (removing comments
and replacing irrelevant parts with `...`) is:

```
TestExceptions.testException(int) /* java::TestExceptions.testException:(I)V */
  IF i >= 0 THEN GOTO 3
  struct java.lang.Exception *new_tmp0;
  new_tmp0 = new struct java.lang.Exception;
  IF !(new_tmp0 == null) THEN GOTO 1

...

1: SKIP
  new_tmp0 . java.lang.Exception.<init>:()V();

...

2: SKIP
  THROW: throw(new_tmp0)
  dead new_tmp0;

...

```
where there is a `THROW` instruction to be replaced.

After passing the goto model through `remove_exceptions`, it is:

```
TestExceptions.testException(int) /* java::TestExceptions.testException:(I)V */
  IF i >= 0 THEN GOTO 4
  struct java.lang.Exception *new_tmp0;
  new_tmp0 = new struct java.lang.Exception;
  IF !(new_tmp0 == null) THEN GOTO 1

...

1: new_tmp0 . java.lang.Exception.<init>:()V();
  IF @inflight_exception == null THEN GOTO 2 // it is because we've not used it yet

...

2: IF !(new_tmp0 == null) THEN GOTO 3

...

3: @inflight_exception = (void *)new_tmp0;
  dead new_tmp0;

...

```
where now instead of the instruction `THROW`, the global variable
`@inflight_exception` holds the thrown exception in a separate goto statement.

\subsection catch CATCH-PUSH, CATCH-POP and EXCEPTION LANDING PAD

Consider the method `catchSomething(I)V` that tries the above method
`testException(I)V` and catches the exception:

```java
public class TestExceptions {
    int field;
    public void testException(int i) throws Exception {
        if (i < 0) {
            throw new Exception();
        }
        field = i;
    }
    public void catchSomething(int i) {
        try {
            testException(i);
        } catch (Exception e) {
        }
    }
}
```

The goto model before `remove_exceptions` is:
```
TestExceptions.catchSomething(int) /* java::TestExceptions.catchSomething:(I)V */

...

  CATCH-PUSH ->2

...

1: SKIP
  this . com.diffblue.regression.TestExceptions.testException:(I)V(i);
  CATCH-POP
  GOTO 3
2: void *anonlocal::2a;
  struct java.lang.Exception *caught_exception_tmp0;
  EXCEPTION LANDING PAD (struct java.lang.Exception * caught_exception_tmp0)
  anonlocal::2a = (void *)caught_exception_tmp0;
  dead caught_exception_tmp0;
  dead anonlocal::2a;

...

```
The `CATCH-PUSH` instruction signifies the start of the try block, the
`CATCH-POP` instruction signifies the end of the try block, and the `EXCEPTION
LANDING PAD` signifies beginning of the catch block.

After `remove_exceptions` the goto model is:

```
TestExceptions.catchSomething(int) /* java::TestExceptions.catchSomething:(I)V */

...

  this . com.diffblue.regression.TestExceptions.testException:(I)V(i);
  IF @inflight_exception == null THEN GOTO 3 // true if testException does not throw, method terminates normally
  IF !(@inflight_exception == null) THEN GOTO 1 // true if testException throws, enters catch block

...

1: __CPROVER_string class_identifier_tmp;
  class_identifier_tmp = ((struct java.lang.Object *)@inflight_exception)->@class_identifier;
  instanceof_result_tmp = class_identifier_tmp == "java::java.lang.Exception" || ... ; // TRUE
  dead class_identifier_tmp;
2: IF instanceof_result_tmp THEN GOTO 4

...

3: ASSERT false // block 3
  GOTO 5
4: void *anonlocal::2a; // The catch block
  struct java.lang.Exception *caught_exception_tmp0;
  ASSERT false // block 4
  caught_exception_tmp0 = (struct java.lang.Exception *)@inflight_exception;
  @inflight_exception = null;
  anonlocal::2a = (void *)caught_exception_tmp0;
  dead caught_exception_tmp0;
  dead anonlocal::2a;
5: ASSERT false // block 5
6: END_FUNCTION
```
where the `CATCH-PUSH` has been replaced by a check on the `@inflight_exception`
variable and goto statements, the `CATCH-POP` replaced by a check on the class
of the exception and a goto statement, and the `EXCEPTION LANDING PAD` replaced
by a section that assigns the exception to a local variable and sets the
`@inflight_exception` back to null.

\section java-bytecode-remove-instanceof Remove instanceof

\ref remove_instanceof.h removes the bytecode instruction `instanceof ` and replaces it with two instructions:
 - check whether the pointer is null
 - if not null, does the class identifier match the type of any of its subtypes

\section java-bytecode-method-stubbing Method stubbing

\section loading-strategies Loading strategies

Loading strategies are policies that determine what classes and method bodies
are loaded. On an initial pass, the symbols for all classes in all paths on
the Java classpath are loaded. Eager loading is a policy that then loads
all the method bodies for every one of these classes. Lazy loading
strategies are policies that only load class symbols and/or method bodies
when they are in some way requested.

The mechanism used to achieve this is initially common to both eager and
context-insensitive lazy loading. \ref java_bytecode_languaget::typecheck calls
[java_bytecode_convert_class](\ref java_bytecode_convert_class)
(for each class loaded by the class loader) to create symbols for all classes
and the methods in them. The methods, along with their parsed representation
(including bytecode) are also added to a map called
\ref java_bytecode_languaget::method_bytecode via a reference held in
\ref java_bytecode_convert_classt::method_bytecode. typecheck then performs a
switch over the value of
[lazy_methods_mode](\ref java_bytecode_language_optionst::lazy_methods_mode) to
determine which loading strategy to use.

\subsection eager-loading Eager loading

If [lazy_methods_mode](\ref java_bytecode_language_optionst::lazy_methods_mode) is
\ref LAZY_METHODS_MODE_EAGER then eager loading is
used. Under eager loading
\ref java_bytecode_languaget::convert_single_method(const irep_idt &, symbol_table_baset &, lazy_class_to_declared_symbols_mapt &, message_handlert &)
is called once for each method listed in method_bytecode (described above). This
then calls
\ref java_bytecode_languaget::convert_single_method(const irep_idt &, symbol_table_baset &, optionalt<ci_lazy_methods_neededt>, lazy_class_to_declared_symbols_mapt &, message_handlert &);

without a ci_lazy_methods_neededt object, which calls
\ref java_bytecode_convert_method, passing in the method parse tree. This in
turn uses \ref java_bytecode_convert_methodt to turn the bytecode into symbols
for the parameters and local variables and finish populating the symbol for the
method, including converting the instructions to a codet.

\subsection java-bytecode-lazy-methods-v1 Context-Insensitive lazy methods (aka lazy methods v1)

Context-insensitive lazy loading is an alternative method body loading strategy
to eager loading that has been used in Deeptest for a while.
Context-insensitive lazy loading starts at the method given by the `--function`
argument and follows type references (e.g. in the definitions of fields and
method parameters) and function references (at function call sites) to
locate further classes and methods to load. The following paragraph describes
the mechanism used.

If [lazy_methods_mode](\ref java_bytecode_language_optionst::lazy_methods_mode) is
\ref LAZY_METHODS_MODE_CONTEXT_INSENSITIVE then
context-insensitive lazy loading is used. Under this stragegy
\ref java_bytecode_languaget::do_ci_lazy_method_conversion is called to do all
conversion. This calls `operator()` of \ref ci_lazy_methodst,
which creates a work list of methods to check, starting with the entry point,
and classes, starting with the types of any class-typed parameters to the entry
point. For each method in the work list it calls
\ref ci_lazy_methodst::convert_and_analyze_method, which calls the same
java_bytecode_languaget::convert_single_method used by eager loading to do the
conversion (via a `std::function` object passed in via parameter
method_converter) and then calls
\ref ci_lazy_methodst::gather_virtual_callsites to locate virtual calls. Any
classes that may implement an override of the virtual function called are added
to the work list. Finally the symbol table is iterated over and methods that
have been converted, their parameters and local variables, globals accessed
from these methods and classes are kept, everything else is thrown away. This
leaves a symbol table that contains reachable symbols fully populated,
including the instructions for methods converted to a \ref codet.

\section java-trace Java Trace Assumptions

For high-level documentation about goto traces, see \ref goto-trace-structure.

There are three types of assignments to construct all types of Java objects:
- variable assignments (\ref symbol_exprt)
- member assignments (\ref member_exprt)
- index assignments (\ref index_exprt)

We use the convention left-hand side (LHS) = right-hand side (RHS) to represent
assignments in this document.

The expressions on each side vary depending on the type, whether its a
member assignment, whether its an assignment by reference, etc. Some examples:
- A global variable assignment will have a LHS \ref symbol_exprt containing the
type information and an identifier that does not include a function
identifier, e.g. `java::SomeClass.someGlobalField`, and a RHS expression
containing the value, e.g. a \ref constant_exprt, a \ref struct_exprt or an
\ref address_of_exprt.
See \ref java-trace-variable-assignment "Variable assignments".
- A local variable assignment will have a LHS \ref symbol_exprt containing the
type information and an identifier that includes a function identifier, e.g.
a parameter assignment like `java::SomeClass.<init>:()V::this` which corresponds
to a symbol with `is_static_lifetime` set to true.
See \ref java-trace-variable-assignment "Variable assignments".
- A member assignment will have a LHS \ref member_exprt containing the type
information for the member, the component name (member name), and an operand for
the containing class which contains an identifier for the containing class, a
RHS expression containing the value. Inherited members have a nested member
structure. Members of members are assigned using a series of single member
assignments. See \ref java-trace-member-assignments "Member assignments".
- An array assignment consists of first assigning to a LHS \ref symbol_exprt
a RHS of type `java::array`, then if the array is non-empty it is followed by a
series of \ref index_exprt assignments to assign elements to the array of the
required type. A notable exception to this assignment structure is when arrays
are created non-deterministically for primitive types - these are created by
assigning an entire array to the `java::array` symbol instead of being built
using index assignments.
See \ref java-trace-array-assignments "Array assignments".

\subsection java-trace-variable-assignment Variable assignments

Variable assignments have LHS \ref symbol_exprt with an identifier that reflects
the variable name and scope and a RHS that is one of the following
(noting that Strings are an exception,
see \ref java-trace-string-assignments "String assignments"):
- \ref constant_exprt (primitives and addresses)
- \ref struct_exprt (reference types, including Java arrays)
- \ref array_exprt (data within Java arrays)

A primitive variable assignment has the form:
- \ref symbol_exprt = \ref constant_exprt with a value representing the primitive

An assignment of a non-primitive (struct) variable can have the following forms:
- \ref symbol_exprt = \ref struct_exprt
- \ref symbol_exprt = \ref constant_exprt with an \ref address_of_exprt pointing to a symbol that has a \ref struct_exprt value

\subsection java-trace-member-assignments Member assignments

\ref struct_exprt that have members are constructed first by an assignment of
the form
- \ref symbol_exprt = \ref struct_exprt

where the members of the \ref struct_exprt are zero-initialized (null for
\ref struct_exprt and 0 for \ref constant_exprt)
then members can be assigned. For primitive members, this is a simple assignment
to the member:
- \ref member_exprt of the \ref symbol_exprt containing the member = \ref constant_exprt with a value representing the primitive

For members of reference type, the object to be assigned must first be created,
then assigned by address, e.g.
- \ref member_exprt of the \ref symbol_exprt containing the member = \ref constant_exprt with an \ref address_of_exprt pointing to a symbol that has a \ref struct_exprt value.

This concept becomes clearer with an example.

\subsection java-trace-member-assignment-example Worked example for member assignments

Consider the trace for the function call to `Example.assignReferenceTypes()`,
which assigns a value to the static field `globalReferenceTypeReferenceField`.

```java
public class Example {
  static ReferenceTypeReferenceField globalReferenceTypeReferenceField;
  public static void assignReferenceTypes() {
    globalReferenceTypeReferenceField =
        new ReferenceTypeReferenceField(new ReferenceTypePrimitiveField(5));
}

class ReferenceTypeReferenceField {
  ReferenceTypePrimitiveField referenceField;
  public ReferenceTypeReferenceField(ReferenceTypePrimitiveField r) {
    referenceField = r;
  }
}

class ReferenceTypePrimitiveField {
  int primitiveField;
  public ReferenceTypePrimitiveField(int i) {
    primitiveField = i;
  }
}
```

There are 54 non-trivial steps in the trace to make this assignment.
This example will give detail of the assignment steps only, filling in other
steps with description.

CProver initialize initializes the instance of the class containing the function under test, Example, to have `null` static field:
- \ref symbol_exprt `java::ObjectReference.globalReferenceTypeReferenceField` = \ref constant_exprt with `null` value

Objects are empty-initialized to build the assignment to `globalReferenceTypeReferenceField`.
`symex_dynamic::dynamic_object1` represents `globalReferenceTypeReferenceField` and `symex_dynamic::dynamic_object2` represents `referenceField`.
- \ref symbol_exprt `symex_dynamic::dynamic_object1` = \ref struct_exprt with `referenceField` set to `null` value
- \ref symbol_exprt `symex_dynamic::dynamic_object2` = \ref struct_exprt with `primitiveField` set to `0`

Call to the constructor of `ReferenceTypePrimitiveField`, initializing the parameters `this` and `i`
- \ref symbol_exprt `java::ReferenceTypePrimitiveField.<init>:(I)V::this` = \ref constant_exprt with \ref address_of_exprt pointing to `symex_dynamic::dynamic_object2`
- \ref symbol_exprt `java::ReferenceTypePrimitiveField.<init>:(I)V::i` = \ref constant_exprt with value `5`

Call to the super constructor (Object). The `to_construct` parameter is internal
- \ref symbol_exprt `java::java.lang.Object.<init>:()V::this` = \ref constant_exprt with \ref address_of_exprt pointing to `symex_dynamic::dynamic_object2`
- \ref symbol_exprt `java::java.lang.Object.<init>:()V::to_construct` = \ref constant_exprt with \ref address_of_exprt pointing to `symex_dynamic::dynamic_object2`

Setting the member of symex_dynamic::dynamic_object2, primitiveField. Note that primitives are always assigned using constant expressions with values.
- \ref member_exprt `symex_dynamic::dynamic_object2.primitiveField` = \ref constant_exprt with value `5`

Call to the constructor of ReferenceTypeReferenceField, initializing the parameters `this` and `r`
- \ref symbol_exprt `java::ReferenceTypeReferenceField.<init>:(LReferenceTypePrimitiveField;)V::this` = \ref constant_exprt with \ref address_of_exprt pointing to `symex_dynamic::dynamic_object1`
- \ref symbol_exprt `java::ReferenceTypeReferenceField.<init>:(LReferenceTypePrimitiveField;)V::r` = \ref constant_exprt with \ref address_of_exprt pointing to `symex_dynamic::dynamic_object2`

Call to the super constructor (Object). The `to_construct` parameter is internal
- \ref symbol_exprt `java::java.lang.Object.<init>:()V::this` = \ref constant_exprt with \ref address_of_exprt pointing to `symex_dynamic::dynamic_object1`
- \ref symbol_exprt `java::java.lang.Object.<init>:()V::to_construct` = \ref constant_exprt with \ref address_of_exprt pointing to `symex_dynamic::dynamic_object1`

Setting the member of symex_dynamic::dynamic_object1, referenceField. Note that this because referenceField is of struct type, it is assigned by reference.
- \ref member_exprt `symex_dynamic::dynamic_object1.referenceField` = \ref constant_exprt with \ref address_of_exprt pointing to `symex_dynamic::dynamic_object2`

Finally, the actual assignment to globalReferenceTypeReferenceField is done by reference to the object we built symex_dynamic::dynamic_object1
- \ref symbol_exprt `java::ObjectReference.globalReferenceTypeReferenceField` = \ref constant_exprt with \ref address_of_exprt pointing to `symex_dynamic::dynamic_object1`
