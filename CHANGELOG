and "integer addressed memory" (usually memory-mapped I/O) has been further
improved.

Numerous improvements to the SMT back-ends.  Specifically, support through
the SMT1 path for Boolector and Z3 has been improved; support for MathSAT
has been added.  In combination with the very latest version of MathSAT,
CBMC now also supports an SMT2 flow (use --mathsat --smt2 to activate this).

Better support for low-level accesses to dynamically allocated data
structures.

Numerous front-end improvements.
