# CBMC 6.3.0

This release addresses build failures on aarch64 (64-bit ARM) platforms (via PR #8366) and for some CMake configurations (via PR #8435). Users of loop invariants with dynamic frames have two changes to their user experience:
1) Users will no longer need to give unwinding specifications for `do { ... } while(0)` loops.
2) Loop invariants that are conjunctions will be turned into more fine-grained properties to ease debugging of loop invariants when they aren't successfully proved.

## What's Changed
