# CBMC Viewer

The cbmc-viewer combines CBMC output into a report that makes it easy to
understand CBMC results and debug CBMC traces.

The usual work flow is to build the goto binary for CBMC

```
cd /path/to/src
make CC=goto-cc
```

and then run CBMC to do property checking and coverage checking

```
cbmc --trace binary.goto > cbmc.txt
cbmc --show-properties --xml-ui binary.goto > property.xml
cbmc --cover location --xml-ui binary.goto > coverage.xml
```

and then run cbmc-viewer on the results

```
cbmc-viewer \
	--goto binary.goto \
	--srcdir /path/to/src \
	--result cbmc.txt \
	--property property.xml \
	--block coverage.xml
```

The result is a report html/index.html that gives

* line coverage generage by CBMC for the statically reachable functions,
* violations found by CBMC sorted by line within function within file,
* error traces generated by CBMC,
* an annotation of the source tree in the style of gcov showing line coverage
  with a primitive linking of symbols to symbol definitions via ctags, and
* an annotation of error traces generated by CBMC linking lines in the trace
  to lines in the code, making it easy to step through a trace and follow it
  in the code.

Future plans include refactoring the code into a small collection of
cooperating command line tools that makes better use of
the json output produced by CBMC.  In particular, the command line tools
will produce json summaries of symbol definitions from ctag and property
and coverage checking from CBMC. Then cbmc-viewer will simply become
a render of the summaries (that can themselves be used to generate statistics
about the proofs in continuous integration.)
