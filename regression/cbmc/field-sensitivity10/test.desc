Fields A::y and A::z should be referred to as atomic symbols (a[12]..y and a[12]..z) but not using
member operators (a[12].[xyz]).
While the field is aliased with a different type, the typecast is successfully reduced to address just
one field, rather than using a byte-update operation against the whole structure.
This is like field-sensitivity8 except the pointer leads into the middle of a field.
