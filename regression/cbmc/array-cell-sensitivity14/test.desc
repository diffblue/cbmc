This checks that mixed array and field accesses are executed using a field-sensitive
symbol (main::1::node1!0@1#2..data) rather than by assigning the whole struct and
expanding into field symbols (which would assign main::1::node1!0@1#3..children\[\[[01]\]\]),
for the case where the array indices only become constant after propagation.
