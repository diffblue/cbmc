This test checks that two usages of the primitive __CPROVER_r_ok() can be false
simultaneously in the encoding of the program. Previously, at most one call
could be false at a time. This was imprecise, however, it was sufficient to
guarantee soundness when the __CPROVER_r_ok() primitive was used directly in an
assertion (i.e., as assert(__CPROVER_r_ok(p, size)). See issue #5194.
