implicit_typecast_arithmetic previously failed to insert a typecast for the
(mathematical) integer-typed expression. This resulted in a multiplication over
mixed types, which sometimes (!) resulted in an invariant failure during
simplification. This was first observed when compiling with GCC 10, cf.
discussion in #6028.
