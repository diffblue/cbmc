Despite the large array inside the union, the test should complete within 10
seconds. Simplify extractbits(concatenation(...)) is essential to make this
possible. With 77236cc34 (Avoid nesting of ID_with/byte_update by rewriting
byte_extract to use the root object) the test already is trivial, however.

This test only fails when using SMT solvers as back-end on Windows.

No body for __CPROVER_allocated_memory
