Field-sensitivity caused a regression such that dereferencing results in an
invalid object even though the pointer should point into an allocated object.
Test derived from SV-COMP's ldv-regression/test_27-1.c. The problem was resolved
in 8ff892778d (Simplify and apply field sensitivity before value-set-deref).
