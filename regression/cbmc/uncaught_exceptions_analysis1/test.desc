When compiling CBMC with -DDEBUG uncaught exception analysis prints an
exceptions map per function.  This test ensures that meta-functions which are
replaced by explicit GOTO instructions (e.g. __CPROVER_assert, __CPROVER_assume)
and thus do not occur as explicit function calls in the final GOTO program are
handled correctly.
