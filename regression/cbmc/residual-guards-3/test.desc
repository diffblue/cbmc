This checks that the assertion, argc == 1, is unguarded (i.e. is not of the form 
'guard => condition'). Such a guard is redundant, but could be added before goto-symex
made sure to restore guards to their state at function entry.
We also check that no VCC is created for the unreachable code 'y = 10;'
--paths mode is excluded as it currently always accrues large guards as it proceeds through execution
