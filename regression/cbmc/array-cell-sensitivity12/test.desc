Ideally we should handle accesses to a pointer with a finite set of possible
referents precisely, but because value_sett regards &array[0].x and &array[0].y
as two different offsets into the same allocation and discards the precise offsets
they point to, this is currently handled imprecisely with a byte_update operation.
