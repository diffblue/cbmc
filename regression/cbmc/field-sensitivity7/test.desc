Fields A::y and A::z should be referred to as atomic symbols (a[12]..y and a[12]..z) but not using
member operators (a[12].[xyz]).
Note the contrast with field-sensitivity4, where the fields the pointer may address are part of the
same allocated object resulting in inability to resolve them, contrasting against this test where
the fields belong to different objects.
