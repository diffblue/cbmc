p\$object
^warning: ignoring

Value sets should be sufficiently precise to infer that dereferencing p is an
access into the array at some offset, and not an access into any other object
(or perhaps the invalid object). If that were the case, the assert instruction
would include "p$object," the absence of which we check for in the above.
