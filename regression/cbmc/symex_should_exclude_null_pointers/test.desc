^warning: ignoring
--
ptrX\$object appearing in the VCCs indicates symex was unsure whether the pointer had a valid
target, and uses the $object symbol as a referred object of last resort. ptr1-3 should be judged
not-null by local safe pointer analysis, so their $object symbols do not occur. ptr4-7 are
not caught by local safe pointer analysis but they are judged safe by value-set filtering, i.e.
goto_symext::try_filter_value_sets(). ptr8-9 are judged safe by local safe pointer analysis but
not value-set filtering. ptr10 is not judged safe by either because it is not safe.
