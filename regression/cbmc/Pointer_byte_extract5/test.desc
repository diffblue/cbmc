Test is built from SV-COMP's memsafety/20051113-1.c_false-valid-memtrack.c.
C90 did not have flexible arrays, and using arrays of size 1 was common
practice: http://c-faq.com/struct/structhack.html. But past C90 using
non-flexible members for struct-hack is undefined, hence we changed the test to
use flexible member instead.
