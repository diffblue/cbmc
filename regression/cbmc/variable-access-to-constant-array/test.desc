This test actually passes when using the SMT2 back-end, but takes 68 seconds to
do so.

Field-sensitive encoding of array accesses for an array of 2^16 elements is very
expensive. We might consider some bounds up to which we actually do field
expansion, or at least need to mark this test as "THOROUGH."
