Test case related to issue #6020: it checks that multi dimensional arrays
are correctly havoced when enforcing invariant contracts.

Here, both assertions are expected to fail -- the entire `data` array should
be havoced since we are assigning to a non-constant index.
We _could_ do a more precise analysis in future where we only havoc
`data[4][5][6]` but not `data[1][2][3]` since the latter clearly cannot be
modified in the given loop.
