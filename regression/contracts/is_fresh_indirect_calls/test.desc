This test checks that the interpretation of is_fresh predicates is 
local to a call. `bar` is called twice with the same arguments.
`bar` calls `foo` so `foo` also gets called twice with the same arguments.
The is_fresh preconditions of `foo` are checked and satisfied independently
for each call.
This shows that the memory_map which keeps track of objects seen by the 
is_fresh predicates and the input and output of a function call is local to
that function call.
