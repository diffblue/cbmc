This test checks that members of statically allocated are correctly havoced
when enforcing loop invariants.
The `t.x == 0 || t.x == 2` assertion is expected to fail when `t.x` is correctly
havoced (so would be set to a nondet value).
However, it `t.x` is not havoced then it stays at value `0` and would satisfy
the assertion when the loop is replaced by a single nondet iteration.
