Checks that assertions generated by the first --pointer-overflow-check:
- do not get duplicated by the second --unsigned-overflow-check
- do not get instrumented with --unsigned-overflow-check (would fail the proof)

We expect 20 assertions to be generated:
In the goto-instrument run:
- 2 for using malloc
- 17 caused by --pointer-overflow-check

In the final cbmc run:
- 0 caused by --pointer-overflow-check
- 1 caused by the --unsigned-overflow-check
