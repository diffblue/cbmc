The purpose of this test is to ensure that we can safely use __CPROVER_forall within both
positive and negative contexts (ENSURES and REQUIRES clauses).

With the SAT backend universal quantifiers in a negative context,
e.g., the ENSURES clause being replaced in this case,
are supported only if the quantifier is bound to a constant range.
