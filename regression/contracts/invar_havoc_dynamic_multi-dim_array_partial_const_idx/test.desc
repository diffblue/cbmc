Test case related to issue #6020: it checks that dynamically allocated multi
dimensional arrays are correctly havoced when enforcing invariant contracts.

Here, both assertions are expected to fail -- the entire `data` array should
be havoced since we are assigning to a non-constant index.
We _could_ do a more precise analysis in future where we only havoc
`data[4][5][6]` but not `data[1][2][3]` since the latter clearly cannot be
modified in the given loop.

Blocked on #6326:
The assigns clause in this case would have an entire 2D grid,
and some of it must be re-established, to the original objects
but with different values at certain locations, by the loop invariant.
However, currently we cannot restrict same_object for pointers
within loop invariants.
