This test is expected to fail because it modifies a variable within a loop,
but attempts to check that it is "effectively constant" without asserting so
within the loop invariant.
The current implementation of `check_apply_invariant` correctly havocs all
variables that are modified within the loop.
The fact that a variable is "effectively constant" within a loop must be
established using an appropriate clause in the invariant.
