Test case related to issue #6020: it checks that dynamically allocated arrays
are correctly havoced when enforcing loop invariant contracts.
The `data[1] == 0 || data[1] == 1` assertion is expected to fail since `data[1]`
is havoced and the invariant does not reestablish the value of `data[1]`.
However, the `data[4] == 0` assertion is expected to pass -- we should not havoc
the entire `data` array, if only a constant index if being modified.
