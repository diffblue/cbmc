Checks that invalidated CARs are correctly tracked on `free` and `DEAD`.

Since several variables are assigned multiple times,
we rule out all failures using the negative regex matches above.

We also check (using positive regex matches above) that
`**p` should be assignable in one case and should not be assignable in the other.
