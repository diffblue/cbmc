The purpose of this test is to ensure that we can safely use __CPROVER_forall
within negative contexts (replaced ENSURES clauses).

With the SAT backend universal quantifiers within a negative context,
e.g., the ENSURES clause being replaced in this case,
are supported only if the quantifier is bound to a constant range.
