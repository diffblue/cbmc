Verification:
  function | pre-cond | post-cond
  ---------|----------|----------
  f1       | assumed  | asserted
  f2_out   | asserted | assumed
  f2_in    | n/a      | n/a

Note: the calls to f2_in does not occur because the call to f2_out is replaced by its contracts.

Recursion:
The base case for the recursive call to f2 provides the same behavior as the common case (given the pre-conditions).
