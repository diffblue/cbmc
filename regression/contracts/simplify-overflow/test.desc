This test doesn't actually use contracts, but rather demonstrates the workflow
of having goto-instrument expand __CPROVER_r_ok (but really doing nothing else)
before CBMC when may add (overflow) checks. Doing so must not result in failing
assertions that would not have failed on the original input.
