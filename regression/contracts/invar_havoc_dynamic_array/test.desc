Test case related to issue #6020: it checks that dynamically allocated arrays
are correctly havoced when enforcing loop invariant contracts.
The `data[5] == 0` assertion is expected to fail since `data` is havoced.
The `data[5] == 1` assertion is also expected to fail since the invariant does
not reestablish the value for `data[5]`.
