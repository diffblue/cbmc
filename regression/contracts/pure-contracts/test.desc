This test demonstrates that calls to functions tagged as pure contracts
replaced by the contract when the command line switch --replace-pure-contracts
is used. foo is a pure contract, bar has the same contract and calls foo.
foo gets replaced in bar, and bar satisfies its contract.
The assertion `foo.pure_contract` is UNREACHABLE or SUCCESS when
all calls to foo have actually been replaced by foo's contract.
