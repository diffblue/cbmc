This test checks that locally declared static variables are correctly detected 
and tracked when function contract replacement is used.
Here, baz declares a local static variable, 
bar calls baz, and we replace the call to baz in bar.
bar also declares a local static array variable.
the call to bar is replaced by its contract in foo.
We see that in foo, two assignments to these local statics are checked,
showing that the replacement of bar in foo is modeled as nondet assignments.
We also see that these assignments are succesfully checked against the empty
assigns clause of foo, which shows that they are automatically propagated to 
the assigns clause of foo as expected.
