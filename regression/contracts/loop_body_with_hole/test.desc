This test checks that we only instrument instructions contained within
the computed natural loops. In a previous commit, an exception was added to
ensure this and it was triggered whenever an instruction within [head,end]
of a loop was not contained within the computed natural loop's "contents".
In this commit, we remove the exception and instead mask out such instructions.

The statement
  flag = true;
in main.c generates such an assignment instruction.
We have added a negative regex to ensure that this instruction is not instrumented.
