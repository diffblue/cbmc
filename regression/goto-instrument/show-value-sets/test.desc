A few basic tests to check if value sets are being handled correctly.

It would be reasonable to ask about the checks for:

main::1::q = \{ <main::1::b, 0, signedbv\[32\]> \}
main::1::q = \{ <main::1::c, 0, signedbv\[32\]> \}

but as domains are stored at the start of instructions the following merge will
over-write it on one branch or the other.  To keep the test portable it is best
avoided.
