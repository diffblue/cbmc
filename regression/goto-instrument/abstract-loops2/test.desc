This test ensures that the loops with loop variable i are not shrunk (so they
appear in unwinding). Although the second loop in main is shrinkable, it is not
in the target loop set provided by --abstractset, thus it shouldn't be shrunk.
The test also ensures the loop in boo() with loop variable j is shrunk and the
constraints are correctly applied.
