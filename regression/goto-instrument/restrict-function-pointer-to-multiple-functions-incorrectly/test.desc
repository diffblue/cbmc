This test checks that multiple restrictions for a given function pointer can be
given.

The test further checks that the correct safety assertions are generated. The
function pointer restriction feature outputs safety assertions for all calls
that it replaces. That is, when it replaces a call with a case distinction over
a given set of functions, it adds an assertion checking that in the original
program, indeed no other function could have been called at that location. In
this case, the function h could also be called, but the given restrictions only
include f and g, hence the safety assertion fails.
