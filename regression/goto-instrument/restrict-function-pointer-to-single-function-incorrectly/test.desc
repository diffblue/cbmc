The function pointer restriction feature outputs safety assertions for all calls
that it replaces. That is, when it replaces a call with a case distinction over
a given set of functions, it adds an assertion checking that in the original
program, indeed no other function could have been called at that location. This
test verifies this feature, by checking that the safety assertion fails when a
function pointer call is replaced by a call to f, when however g could be called
in the original program.
