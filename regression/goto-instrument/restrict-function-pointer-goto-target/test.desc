This test checks that a function pointer call that is the target of a goto (in
the goto program) is correctly handled. Previously there was a bug, as the
function pointer labelling step which is part of the restrict function pointer
feature inserted a new instruction before the function pointer call, but did
not adjust the goto targets.
