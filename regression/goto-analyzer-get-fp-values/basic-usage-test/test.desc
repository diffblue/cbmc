The exclusion here is happening because top function pointers shouldn't come up in the restrictions
(i.e. they should be unrestricted).address

Also note that the assertion results here are nearly identical (modulo naming) with those
you'd get from cbmc without function pointer restrictions. This is by design, because if
this feature works correctly cbmc should behave the same way except it has less work to do.
