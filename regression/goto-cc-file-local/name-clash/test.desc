This test contains two identically-named static functions in two
identically-named files in different directories. The name-mangling
scheme will give the static functions identical names when they get
exported. This test ensures that the compiler emits a warning about
this.

CBMC spins forever when run on the final object file, since the 'foo'
implementation of `static_fun` is the one that is kept. There is thus an
infinite loop where foo/static_fun() calls bar(), and bar() calls
foo/static_fun() instead of bar/static_fun().
