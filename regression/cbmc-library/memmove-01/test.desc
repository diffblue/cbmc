Since we cannot constant-propagate lsize, we generate byte_extract operations
over an int-array of unknown size when invoking memmove. This could be fixed by
not using array_copy/array_replace in memmove, extensions to the byte-operator
lowering, or field-sensitive SSA (this regression test is fully deterministic).
