Assert uses function bar which has index "i" explicitly in the args list. But another index 
k derived from i is used to access the abstracted array. 
We should error out in this case. The abstraction will be conservative meaning it will lead to spurious counterexamples and there is 
no way to remove these spurious traces as long as we are using the scheme (is_precise(i) ==> bar(....,i)).
