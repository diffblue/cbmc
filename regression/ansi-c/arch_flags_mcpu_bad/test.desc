This tests the -mcpu=cortex=a15 flag that should activate ARM-32 mode.
The object file 'object.intel' was compiled from 'source.c' with goto-cc
on a 64-bit platform:

  goto-cc -c source.c -o object.intel

preproc.i is already pre-processed so that it can be linked in without
needing to invoke a pre-processor from a cross-compile toolchain on your
local machine. Linking it together with the Intel object file, while
passing -mcpu=cortex-a15 on the command line, should fail because
-mcpu=cortex-a15 implies that we're trying to make an ARM executable.
