This tests the -mcpu=cortex-a15 flag that should activate ARM-32 mode.
The object file 'object.arm' was compiled from 'source.c' with goto-cc
along with an ARM cross-compiler on a 64-bit platform with the following
command line:

  goto-cc --native-compiler=arm-none-eabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-a15 -c source.c

preproc.i is already pre-processed so that it can be linked in without
needing to invoke a pre-processor from a cross-compile toolchain on your
local machine. Linking it together with the ARM object file, while
passing -mcpu=cortex-a15 on the command line, should succeed.
