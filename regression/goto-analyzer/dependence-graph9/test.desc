The first regex above matches output portions like shown below (with <N> being a
location number). The intention is to check whether the assignment has a control
dependency on the outer if.

        // <N> file main.c line 7 function main
        IF !(i < 10) THEN GOTO 2
...
**** 6 file main.c line 14 function main
Control dependencies: <N>

        // 6 file main.c line 14 function main
        a = 2;

The second regex above matches output portions like shown below (with <N> being
a location number). The intention is to check that the assignment does not have
a control dependency on the inner if.

        // <N> file main.c line 9 function main
        IF !(i < 7) THEN GOTO 1
...
**** 6 file main.c line 14 function main
Control dependencies: <N>

        // 6 file main.c line 14 function main
