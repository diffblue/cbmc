Under the current implementation of monotonic-change predicate abstraction, this
test case fails. Specifically, it will report a run-time error that one of the
preconditions in the code base is violated. I will now explain the reason for
the failure. 

First of all, *p is expanded to *(p+0). Here, the offset 0 will be represented
by an abstract value in whatever value domain we choose. This is due to the fact
that memory addresses and array indices are treated as values just like
integers. 

In this test case, the value domain is monotonic-change. Hence, 0 will be
represented by one of the abstract values in this abstract domain. However,
unlike interval analysis, monotonic-change predicate abstraction does not keep
track of variables' values. It only keeps track of variables' monotonicity
statuses. Consequently, once we convert a concrete value (i.e. the offset 0) to
an abstract value of monotonic-change predicate abstraction, we have no way to
recover the concrete value back from the abstract value. This is why this test
case results in a precondition violation.
