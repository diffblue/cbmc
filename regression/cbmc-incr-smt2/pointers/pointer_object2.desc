Ensure that two variables which can get assigned the address of the
same object satisfy the __CPROVER_same_object predicate. In the code
under test, we negate the predicate to be able to get a failure and a
trace which we can then match against expected values which guide
through the path that leads to the two variables getting assigned the
same object.
