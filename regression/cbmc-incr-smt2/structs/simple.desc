Test that we support struct values and traces for a trivial example. At the
time of adding the regression test, this exercised the conversion code specific
to struct_tag_typet and struct_exprt. Field sensitivity is expected to eliminate
many of the struct specific expressions before they can reach the decision
procedure with this simple example.
