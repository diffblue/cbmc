Problem parsing linker script
^warning: ignoring

Tesing the functionality of goto-cc's linker script parsing
functionality, ensuring that it can get the values of symbols that are
defined in linker scripts.

This test ensures that goto-cc and ls-parse can:

- get the value of a symbol whose value indicates the start of a section;
- get the value of a symbol whose value indicates the size of a section,
  and whose value has been generated through a basic arithmetic
  expression in the linker script.
