Tests that an inconsistent assumption involving a pointer initialized to an
integer address not pointing to memory and __CPROVER_r_ok() can be detected via
assert(0). We use --no-simplify and --no-propagation to ensure that the case is
not solved by the constant propagation and thus tests the constraint encoding.
