Without the change that drives the refinement of the guard for a `ID_implies`
statement in `goto-check`, this will fail with a counterexample of `y = 0`.
With the bug fix, the `--div-by-zero-check` will succeed because the
antecedent of the conditional is becoming the guard for the consequent,
guarding any checks performed there.
