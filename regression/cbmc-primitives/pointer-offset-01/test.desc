For uninitialised pointers, CBMC chooses a nondeterministic value (though no
memory is allocated).  Since the offset of pointers is unsigned, negative
offsets cannot be chosen.  `__CPROVER_POINTER_OFFSET` is the CBMC primitive
that gets the pointer offset from the base address of the object.  This test
guards this.
