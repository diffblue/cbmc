Check that memory checks fail for pointer dereferences inside an existential
qualifier, for out of bounds memory access, when using the smt backend and
the range of the index is unbound. Note that this test is not expected to work
with the SAT backend at the time of writing, as the SAT backend does not support
qualifiers in this form.
