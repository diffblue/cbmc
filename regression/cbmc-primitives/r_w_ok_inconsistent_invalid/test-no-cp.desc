^warning: ignoring
--
Tests that an inconsistent assumption involving the special invalid pointer
value and __CPROVER_r_ok() can be detected via assert(0). We use --no-simplify
and --no-propagation to ensure that the case is not solved by the constant
propagation and thus tests the constraint encoding.
