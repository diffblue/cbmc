Check that the dynamic object property is nondet for uninitialized pointers. We
use --no-simplify and --no-propagation to ensure that the case is not solved by
the constant propagation and thus tests the constraint encoding. We expect
that `__CPROVER_DYNAMIC_OBJECT` should be nondet for pointers that are neither
null nor valid.
