Copied from test1.
Main.c has a simple while loop that compares a1 and a2 but it also has "sum" 
which is not an abstracted variable that is being assigned inside the loop. This should 
lead to an error.

With spec2.json it would seem there should be no error as "sum" is 
also an abstracted entity. But that's not the case: value of sum is dependent on it's
value from the previous iteration. So it's dependent on the length of the loop, and this
should also lead to an error.

Spec1.json is not used.
