Copied from test1.
Main.c has a simple while loop that copies a2 array into a1 but it also has "sum" 
which is not an abstracted variable that is being assigned inside the array. This should 
lead to an error.

With spec2.json there should be no error.
Value of "sum" is not dependent on the loop size.

Spec1.json is not used.
