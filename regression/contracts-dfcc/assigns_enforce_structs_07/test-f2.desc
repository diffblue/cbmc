In f1, the assigns clause specifies `*(p->buf)` as target (which can be invalid)
and assigns `p->buf[0]` unconditionally. When both target and lhs are invalid,
its inclusion check can be trivially satisfied (or not) but we expect the target
validity check to fail.

In f2 tests this behaviour with chained dereferences.
