The purpose of this test is to ensure that we can safely use __CPROVER_exists
within positive contexts (enforced ENSURES clauses).

With the SAT backend existential quantifiers in a positive context,
e.g., the ENSURES clause being enforced in this case,
are supported only if the quantifier is bound to a constant range.
