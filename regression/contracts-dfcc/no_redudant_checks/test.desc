Checks that assertions generated by the first --pointer-overflow-check:
- do not get duplicated by the second --unsigned-overflow-check
- do not get instrumented with --unsigned-overflow-check (would fail the proof)

We expect 17 assertions caused by --pointer-overflow-check
In the final cbmc run:
- 0 caused by --pointer-overflow-check
- 1 caused by the --unsigned-overflow-check
