This test demonstrates a simplification that is now possible on loop contracts.

Prior to this commit, loop contracts were unconditionally applied on loops,
and thus had to also consider the case when the loop doesn't run even once.

The contracts that were previously necessary were:
  __CPROVER_loop_invariant(
    (start > size && end == start) || (start <= end && end <= size)
  )
  __CPROVER_decreases(
    max(start, size) - end
  )
