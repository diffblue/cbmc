This test checks that assuming is_fresh(ptr, size) with a non-deterministic size
checks that size < __CPROVER_max_malloc_size and then assumes it.
This guarantees that the address `ptr + size` can always be computed and
represented without offset bits overflowing into the object bits in the pointer
model used by CBMC.
