This test checks that:
- built-ins __CPROVER_assignable, __CPROVER_object_whole, __CPROVER_object_from,
  __CPROVER_object_upto are supported;
- GOTO conversion preserves calls to __CPROVER_object_whole,
  __CPROVER_object_upto, __CPROVER_object_from;
- GOTO conversion translates __CPROVER_typed_target to __CPROVER_assignable;
- user-defined checks embedded in `my_write_set` persist after conversion.
