Checks whether verification succeeds when a member of formal parameter
(with type of pointer to struct) outside of the assigns clause is assigned
after being pointed at the location of a member sub-struct of a freshly
allocated struct before being assigned. This is meant to show that all
contained members (and their contained members) of assignable structs
are valid to assign.
