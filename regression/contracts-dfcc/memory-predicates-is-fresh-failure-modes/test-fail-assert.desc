This tests shows that using is_fresh with --malloc-fail-assert active and
without imposing a limit on the size parameter results in an failed assertion
in is_fresh that detects that the size may be too large, but also results in an
implicit assumption that the size is less than the maximum allocation size
(just like when used with malloc).
