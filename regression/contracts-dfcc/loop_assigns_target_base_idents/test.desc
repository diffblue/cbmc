This test checks that the optimisation that consists in not tracking locally
declared array symbols in the write set *not* kick in when said symbols are
assigned by a loop. This specifically tests the pattern matchin logic that is
used to identify the set of base symbols touched by an assigns clause target.
In particular the succesfull check
`[foo.assigns.*] Check assigns clause inclusion for loop foo.0`
shows that the targets listed in the loop's assigns clause are also found in the
function write set and hence explicitly tracked.
