This test checks that the decreases clause is evaluated only within the loop iteration,
not outside of it (before the loop guard).
The `main.overflow.1` check would fail if the decreases clause `(max - i)` is evaluated
before the loop guard is satisfied. This would occur when `start > max` and therefore
`i > max` after assuming the invariant.
