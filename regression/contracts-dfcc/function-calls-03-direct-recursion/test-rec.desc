This test checks that when checking a contract against a function using
--enforce-contract-rec, if the function is recursive and satsifies the contract
then the verification succeeds.
We want to see that post conditions are checked (top level call)
and preconditions are checked (recursive call).
We also want to see assigns and frees clause inclusion checks.
