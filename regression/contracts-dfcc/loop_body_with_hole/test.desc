This test checks that we only instrument instructions contained in natural loops
against loop write sets.
The variable `flag` is not listed in the assigns clause of the loop.
The statement `flag = true;` is not part of the natural loop since it is only
executed once when breaking out of the loop. In the goto program this assignment
it is found between the loop head instruction and the loop latch instructions
it should not cause an loop assigns clause violation.
