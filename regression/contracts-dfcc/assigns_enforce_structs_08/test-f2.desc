In f1, the assigns clause specifies `*(p->buf)` as target (which can be invalid)
and assigns `p->buf[0]` unconditionally. When both target and lhs are invalid,
its  inclusion check can be trivially satisfied or not but we expect in all
cases a  null pointer failure and an invalid pointer error to occur 
on the assignment.

In f2 tests this behaviour with chained dereferences.
