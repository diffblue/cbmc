This test checks that the front end parses and typechecks correct uses of
- void function calls as frees clause targets
- the predicate __CPROVER_freeable
- the predicate __CPROVER_is_freeable
- the predicate __CPROVER_was_freed

The post condition of the contract is expected to fail because the predicates
have no interpretation in the back-end yet.
