Test case related to issue #6020: it checks that dynamically allocated multi
dimensional arrays are correctly havoced when enforcing invariant contracts.

The `data[4][5][6] == 0` assertion is expected to fail since `data[4][5][6]`
is havoced and the invariant does not reestablish its value.
However, the `data[1][2][3] == 0` assertion is expected to pass -- we should
not havoc the entire `data` array, if only a constant index if being modified.
