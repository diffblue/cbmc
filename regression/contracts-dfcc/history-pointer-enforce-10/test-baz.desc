This test checks that history variables are supported for structs, symbols, and
struct members. By using the --enforce-contract flag, the postcondition
(with history variable) is asserted. In this case, this assertion should pass.
Note: A function is always authorized to assign the variables that store
its arguments, there is no need to mention them in the assigns clause.
