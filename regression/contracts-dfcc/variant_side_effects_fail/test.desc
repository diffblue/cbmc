^Decreases clause is not side-effect free. \(at: file main.c line .* function main\)$

This test fails because the decreases clause contains a side effect, namely
incrementing variable N by zero. In this case, although the value of N
remains unchanged after the increment operation, we read from and write to N.
So this constitues a side effect. Decreases clauses are banned from containing
side effects, since decreases clauses should not modify program states.
