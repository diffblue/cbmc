This test (taken from #6021) shows the need for assigns clauses on loops.
The alias analysis in this case returns `unknown`,
and so we must manually annotate an assigns clause on the loop.

Note that the annotated assigns clause in this case is an underapproximation,
because `i` is also assigned in the loop and should be marked as assignable.
