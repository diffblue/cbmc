If we use side_effect_expr_nondett then dump_c will generation function calls
to functions with names like nondet_signed_int without declaration.
This can cause problems around usability.

To fix this, we changed goto-harness to just not use side_effect_expr_nondett
at all.

This test tests for the absence the use for these things.
