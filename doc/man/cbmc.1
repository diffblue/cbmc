.SH NAME
cbmc \- Bounded Model Checker for C and C++ programs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cbmc [--claim \fIclaim-nr\fB] \fIfile.c\fB ...

.B cbmc [--show-claims] \fIfile.c\fB ...

.B cbmc [--all-claims] \fIfile.c\fB ...

.B goto-cc [-I \fIinclude-path\fB] [-c] \fIfile.c\fB [-o \fIoutfile.o\fB]

.B goto-instrument \fIinfile\fB \fIoutfile\fR

.PP
Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the remainder.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcbmc\fR generates traces that demonstrate how an assertion can be
violated, or proves that the assertion cannot be violated within a given
number of loop iterations.  CBMC can read source-code directly, or a
goto-binary generated by goto-cc.  Without any further options, cbmc checks
all properties (automatically generated or user-specificed) found in the
program.  If any of the properties can be violated, a counterexample is
printed and the analysis is aborted.  The analysis can be restricted to a
particular claim with the --claim option.  The verification result for all
claims can be obtained by means of the --all-claims option.

\fBgoto-cc\fR reads source code, and generates a goto-binary. It's
command-line interface is designed to mimic that of
.BR gcc (1).
Note in particular that \fBgoto-cc\fR distinguishes between compiling
and linking phases, just as gcc does. \fBcbmc\fR expects a goto-binary
for which linking has been completed.

\fBgoto-instrument\fR reads a goto-binary, performs a given program
transformation, and then writes the resulting program as goto-binary on
disc.

The usual flow is to (1) translate source into a goto-binary using
goto-cc, then (2) perform instrumentation with goto-instrument, and
finally (3) perform the analysis with cbmc.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "FRONTEND OPTIONS (cbmc and goto-cc)"
.IP "-I path"
Set include path (C/C++)
.IP "-D macro"
Define preprocessor macro (C/C++)
.IP --preprocess
Stop after preprocessing
.IP --show-symbol-table
Show symbol table
.IP --show-goto-functions

.SS "ARCHITECTURAL OPTIONS (cbmc and goto-cc)"
\fBcbmc\fR by default uses architectural settings that match those of the
machine \fBcbmc\fR is executed on, i.e., the settings below are only needed
when verifying software that is meant to run on a different architecture
or OS. \fBgoto-cc\fR generates a goto-binary for a particular architecture,
i.e., the architecture cannot be changed after the goto-binary is generated.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
CBMC does not regognize any environment variables. Note, however, that
the preprocessor used by CBMC will use environment variables to locate
header files. GOTO-CC aims to accept all environment variables that GCC
does.
