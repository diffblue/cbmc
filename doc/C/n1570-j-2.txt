— A signal is raised while the quick_exit function is executing (7.22.4.7).

— A command is executed through the system function in a way that is documented as
causing termination or some other form of undefined behavior (7.22.4.8).

— A searching or sorting utility function is called with an invalid pointer argument, even
if the number of elements is zero (7.22.5).

— The comparison function called by a searching or sorting utility function alters the
contents of the array being searched or sorted, or returns ordering values
inconsistently (7.22.5).

— The array being searched by the bsearch function does not have its elements in
proper order (7.22.5.1).

— The current conversion state is used by a multibyte/wide character conversion
function after changing the LC_CTYPE category (7.22.7).

— A string or wide string utility function is instructed to access an array beyond the end
of an object (7.24.1, 7.29.4).

— A string or wide string utility function is called with an invalid pointer argument, even
if the length is zero (7.24.1, 7.29.4).

— The contents of the destination array are used after a call to the strxfrm,
strftime, wcsxfrm, or wcsftime function in which the specified length was
too small to hold the entire null-terminated result (7.24.4.5, 7.27.3.5, 7.29.4.4.4,
7.29.5.1).

— The first argument in the very first call to the strtok or wcstok is a null pointer
(7.24.5.8, 7.29.4.5.7).

— The type of an argument to a type-generic macro is not compatible with the type of
the corresponding parameter of the selected function (7.25).

— A complex argument is supplied for a generic parameter of a type-generic macro that
has no corresponding complex function (7.25).

— At least one member of the broken-down time passed to asctime contains a value
outside its normal range, or the calculated year exceeds four digits or is less than the
year 1000 (7.27.3.1).

— The argument corresponding to an s specifier without an l qualifier in a call to the
fwprintf function does not point to a valid multibyte character sequence that
begins in the initial shift state (7.29.2.11).

— In a call to the wcstok function, the object pointed to by ptr does not have the
value stored by the previous call for the same wide string (7.29.4.5.7).

— An mbstate_t object is used inappropriately (7.29.6).

— The value of an argument of type wint_t to a wide character classification or case
mapping function is neither equal to the value of WEOF nor representable as a
wchar_t (7.30.1).

— The iswctype function is called using a different LC_CTYPE category from the
one in effect for the call to the wctype function that returned the description
(7.30.2.2.1).

— The towctrans function is called using a different LC_CTYPE category from the
one in effect for the call to the wctrans function that returned the description
(7.30.3.2.1).
