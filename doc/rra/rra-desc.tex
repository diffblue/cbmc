\section{Formalizing RRA}~\label{sec:rra}

User first specifies the arrays to be abstracted along with the shapes
to use. In \emph{aws\_array\_eq} example the shape used can be written
as {\it *c*}, that is, track one location precisely and abstract the
locations before and after it. For the rest of this presentation, we
will fix the shape to be {\it *c*c*} which keeps track of two locations
\(c_1 < c_2\). In general, the shape  {\it *c*c*} can also represent
cases where \((c_1 = c_2 - 1)\), that is, they are adjacent. This
would complicate \(\abst\) and \(\conc\) functions described
below. To keep the presentation simple we assume \(c_1 < c_2 -
1\). Let the array to be abstracted be \aid. Extension to other
shapes and multiple arrays is straightforward. The abstraction
function \(\abst\) mapping concrete indices to abstract indices is
parameterized by the values \(c_1, c_2\) for the precise locations and
is as follows:

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \(\abst(v)\) & = & 0 if \(v < c_1\) \\
    &=& 1 if \(v = c_1\) \\
    &=& 2 if \(c_1 < v < c_2\) \\
    &=& 3 if \(v = c_2\) \\
    &=& 4 if \(v > c_2\)
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

There will be a corresponding concretization function as follows:

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \(\conc(0)\)  &=& \(\{v \mid \mbox{ where } 0 \leq  v < c_1\}\) \\
    \(\conc(1)\)  &=& \(\{c_1\}\) \\
     \(\conc(2)\) &=& \(\{v \mid \mbox{ where } 0 \leq  c_1 < v < c_2\}\) \\ 
    \(\conc(3)\)  &=& \(\{c_2\}\) \\
     \(\conc(4)\) &=& \(\{v \mid \mbox{ where } 0 \leq  v > c_2\}\)
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

Misusing notation slightly \(\abst\) and \(\conc\) can be applied to arrays too.
Let length of \(\aobj\) be \(l\) such that \(c_2 < l\) and its range be \sizet. Then

\(\abst(\aobj)\) is an array \(\aabstobj\) of length 5 such that

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \(\aabstobj[1]\)  &=& \(\aobj[c_1]\) \\
    \(\aabstobj[3]\)  &=& \(\aobj[c_2]\) \\
    \(\aabstobj[x]\)  &=& \(\tp\) for \(x \notin [1,3]\)\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

The special value \(\tp\) at abstract locations in \(\aabstobj\) indicates that
reads from those locations can return any value.

\begin{remark}
Abstraction function \(\abst\) assumes that \(\aobj\) is at least
\(c_2+1\) elements in length. Now the lowest value for \(c_2\) can be
\(2\) which happens when \(c_1 = 0\). So \(\aobj\) has to be of length
at least 3 and soundness results discussed below hold only for arrays
of size 3 or more. Regular CBMC without abstraction is any way
adequate for smaller arrays and abstraction is meant to make large
arrays manageable.
\end{remark}

Given an
array \(\aabstobj\) of length 5, \(\conc(\aabstobj)\) is the set of
all arrays \(\aobj\) of length at least \(c_2+1\) such that

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \(\aobj[c_1]\)  &=& \(\aabstobj[1]\) \\
    \(\aobj[c_2]\)  &=& \(\aabstobj[3]\) \\
    \(\aobj[x]\)  &=& \(v \in \sizet\) for \(x \notin [c_1,c_2]\)\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

Note that an abstract array can concretize to a set of different
concrete arrays. Abstracting and then concretizing an array will give us a
set containing the original array. That is,
\[\aobj \in \conc(\abst(\aobj))\]

Functions \(\abst\) and \(\conc\) operate on states and since states are
available only during execution these two functions are used
dynamically as the program is being model checked.

We will next define a function \tr{} that syntactically transforms a
given program \prog{} to a program \progabst. This will essentially involve
identifying entities to be abstracted, substituting them with abstract
entities, and rewriting program logic to work with abstracted
entities.

\subsection{Preprocessing phase}

In the abstract program \aid{} will be replaced by \aabstid{}. Now
\aabstid{} might be passed to other functions as an argument, say as
an argument named \aargid{} for some function {\tt foo}. When we
transform \prog{} we have to change \aargid{} to an abstract entity as
well. We first identify all arrays in all functions that can get their
value from \aid{}, the main array being abstracted. This can be done
statically by following assignments in function bodies, tracing
arguments as they are passed between functions and computing a closure
of the possible set of values for each array identifier. If an
identifier \aargid{} can get value from the array to be abstracted
and also from a normal array then our abstraction procedure throws an
exception. That's because we have to rewrite {\tt foo} to handle the case
when its argument is an abstract array but we also need to keep it as
is for the case when it receives a normal array argument. Assuming
this doesnâ€™t happen we identify the set \arrayids{} of array
identifiers that need to be abstracted.

\begin{remark}
Requiring that an array identifier not get values from abstract and normal
arrays is quite restrictive. But as we are relying on array
names to keep track of heap objects we necessarily introduce
imprecision in our method. For a general method we should
determine if an array is abstract or not using its address, not its
name.
\end{remark}

Any variable used to iterate over abstract arrays also needs to be
replaced with a new variable with reduced range. This is what will
allow us to shorten the traces CBMC has to explore. An
intra-procedural closure analysis is performed starting with the set
\(I_0\) of expressions that directly index into the arrays in
\arrayids. For each expression we also add it's sub-expressions to the
set. Any expression (along with it's sub-expressions) that is assigned
to an expression in \(I_0\) is added to the set \(I_1\) (which is
initialized to \(I_0\)) and so on till we reach a fix point. Now we
intersect this with the set of variables appearing in the conditions
of while loops. Any variable appearing in both sets is added to the
set \indexids.

For example, consider the following program.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l}
    {\tt i = 0;} \\
    {\tt res = true;} \\
    {\tt while( i $!=$ len) do \{}  \\
    \hspace{1cm} {\tt j = i;} \\
    \hspace{1cm} {\tt res = res \&\& (arr[j] $!=$ 10);} \\
    \hspace{1cm}  {\tt i = i + 1;} \\
    \}\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}
      
\(I_0\) = \{{\tt j}\}, \(I_1 =\) \{{\tt i, i+1, j}\}. Since only i appears in the condition of the while loop \indexids = \{i\}.

As another example consider the following program where only {\tt arr} is being abstracted:

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l}
    {\tt i = 0;} \\
    {\tt res = true;} \\
    {\tt while( i $!=$ len) do \{}  \\
    \hspace{1cm} {\tt j = i;} \\
    \hspace{1cm} {\tt res = res \&\& (arr[arr1[j]] $!=$ 10);} \\
    \hspace{1cm}  {\tt i = i + 1;} \\
    \}\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

Here \(I_0\) = \{{\tt arr1[j], j}\}, \(I_1\) = \{{\tt i, j, arr1[j]}\} and \indexids = \{{\tt i}\}.



\subsection{Program Transformation}

    
Using \arrayids{} and \indexids{} computed in the preprocessing phase, we
will describe the program transformation \tr{} that rewrites concrete
program into an abstract program. The transformation first adds the
declaration
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
      {\tt uint c1, c2;}
\end{figure}

to represent the free reference variables used in the
abstraction. For all  in \({\tt var} \in\) \indexids{} we add the declaration

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
      {\tt type var\$abst}
\end{figure}

where {\tt type} matches the type of {\tt var} in case of
\indexids. In case of \({\tt arr} \in\) \arrayids{} it adds 

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
      {\tt array[5] of uint arr\$abst}
\end{figure}

That is, we declare a new array variable {\tt arr\$abst} with exactly
5 cells. The number 5 is determined by the shape \(*c*c*\) we are
using for the abstraction.

Next \tr{} rewrites each function as follows.

\subsubsection{Rewrites for function declarations}

Every function has a declaration followed by a list of
instructions. Function declarations are left unchanged:

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lcl}
    \tr({\tt type funcname(var)}) & \ra & {\tt type funcname( var)}
  \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

If \({\tt var} \in\)
\indexids{} \(\cup\) \arrayids{} we add the following assignment right after the
declaration

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
      {\tt var\$abst} = \(\abst({\tt var})\)
\end{figure}

\begin{remark}
As the subsequent rewrite rules show we make sure a function always
returns a concrete value. The burden of abstracting the
return value is placed on the instruction containing the function
call.
  
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Rewrite for instructions}

For rewriting instructions, \tr{} will make use of two helper function
\trrd, \trwr{} both of which operate on expressions.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lcl}
    
\tr({\tt while cond do instrs}) & \ra & {\tt while(}\trrd{\tt (cond)) do} \tr{\tt (instrs)} \\

\tr({\tt exp1 = exp2}) & \ra &  if {\tt exp1} \(\in\) \indexids{} then \\
&&                                          {\tt exp1\$abst  =} \(\abst\)(\trrd({\tt exp2})) \\
      &&                                    else \trwr({\tt exp1}) {\tt =} \trrd({\tt exp2}) \\

\tr({\tt funcname(exps)})  & \ra &   {\tt funcname(}\trrd({\tt exps}){\tt )} \\

\tr({\tt assert(exp)})  & \ra &  {\tt assert(}\trrd ({\tt exp}){\tt )} \\

\tr({\tt assume(exp)})  & \ra & {\tt assume(}\trrd ({\tt exp}){\tt )} \\
 
\tr({\tt return(exp)}) & \ra &  {\tt return(}\trrd ({\tt exp}){\tt )} \\ 
                                       
  \end{tabular}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Rewrite for expressions}

Expressions are transformed using \trrd{} and \trwr. We assume the
availability of a function {\tt nondet()} that returns a random value
from {\tt uint}. We first define \trrd.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lcl}
    
\trrd ({\tt i}) & \ra & if {\tt i} \(\in\) \indexids{} then  \(\conc\){\tt (i\$abst)} else {\tt i} \\

\trrd ({\tt a[exp]}) & \ra & if {\tt a} \(\in\) \arrayids{} then \\
		&&	 \hspace{0.5cm} {\tt is\_precise(expâ€™)? a\$abst[expâ€™] : nondet()} \\
&&	 \hspace{0.5cm}  where {\tt expâ€™ = }\(\abst\) (\trrd ({\tt exp})) \\
%%&& \hspace{0.5cm} {\tt nondet} is a value from {\tt a's} range \\
		  &&     else {\tt a[}\trrd {\tt (exp)]} \\

\trrd ({\tt exp1 + exp2}) & \ra & \trrd ({\tt exp1}) {\tt +} \trrd ({\tt exp2}) \\

\trrd ({\tt exp1 rel\_op exp2}) & \ra &  \trrd ({\tt exp1}) {\tt rel\_op} \trrd ({\tt exp2}) \\

\trrd ({\tt exp~?~exp1~:~exp2}) & \ra &  \trrd ({\tt exp}) {\tt ?} \trrd ({\tt exp1}) {\tt :} \trrd ({\tt exp2}) \\

\trrd ({\tt funcname(exps)}) & \ra & {\tt funcname}(\trrd ({\tt exps})) \\

  \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

Function {\tt is\_precise} used above is defined as follows:

{\tt is\_precise(v) = v}\(\in\){\tt \{1,3\}? true : false}

Recall that we are abstracting using \(*c*c*\) and so indices 1, 3 are
the precise locations. Observe that \trrd{} always returns a concrete
value, never an abstract value. In case it is applied to an abstracted
index {\tt i\$abst}, it concretizes it as \(\conc\)({\tt i\$abst}),
allowing for a set of values all of which are concrete. This is a
slight abuse of notation as we are replacing a variable {\tt i} by a
set. The intended meaning is we can non-deterministically pick any
value from the set.
 
Next \trwr{} which is used to rewrite left hand sides of assign
instructions is defined.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lcl}

    \trwr({\tt i}) & \ra & if {\tt i} \(\in\) \indexids{} then {\tt i\$abst} else {\tt i} \\

\trwr({\tt a[exp]}) & \ra & if {\tt a} \(\in\) \arrayids{} then {\tt a\$abst[}\(\abst\))(\trrd ({\tt exp}){\tt]} \\
	               &&     else {\tt a[}\trrd({\tt exp}){\tt ]} \\

\trwr({\tt exp1 rel\_op exp2}) & \ra & throw exception (cannot occur on lhs) \\

\trwr({\tt exp1 + exp2}) & \ra & throw exception (cannot occur on lhs) \\

\trwr({\tt exp~?~exp1~:~exp2}) & \ra & throw exception (cannot occur on lhs) \\

\trwr({\tt funcname(exps)}) & \ra & throw exception (func exp cannot be on the lhs) \\

   \end{tabular}
\end{figure}





Like {\tt P} the abstracted program {\tt P\$abst} too has states comprising of
valuations of variables. The only
difference is that states of {\tt P\$abst} have abstracted values for
entities corresponding to \arrayids{} and \indexids. Everything else is
the same. In particular, the initial state \(Init\) of {\tt P} matches the
initial state  \(Init\$abst\) of {\tt P\$abst}, except for entities
in \arrayids{} and \indexids{} which appear abstracted in \({Init\$abst}\).
