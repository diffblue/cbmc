## Process

The current process we follow through to make a new release is the following:

1. At the point in time we want to make the release, we make a change to
   three files: `src/config.inc`, wherein we update the configuration variable
   `CBMC_VERSION`, src/libcprover-rust/Cargo.toml`, wherein we update
   the `version` variable to be the same as `CBMC_VERSION` (e.g. set both
   to `5.80.0`), and CHANGELOG.

   This is important as it informs the various tools of the current version of
   CBMC. These changes need to be pushed as a PR. Once that PR is merged into
   `develop`, a Git tag of the form `cbmc-<version>` (where `<version>` is the
   value of `CBMC_VERSION`) is automatically created. This tag then triggers
   further automatic steps, see below.

2. Pushing the Rust crate, which is documented [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-publish.html)
   but effectively entails logging in with an API token generated from
   https://crates.io with `cargo login`, and then issuing `cargo publish`.

   The usual environment variables are required (part of the `publish`
   step is that the crate can be built) - these are documented in the
   `readme.md` file at the root of the `src/libcprover-rust/` directory,
   and online at [libcprover_rust](https://crates.io/crates/libcprover_rust).

   For the crate to be pushed successfully, the user performing the `cargo
   publish` step needs to be a member of the [diffblue/diffblue-opensource](https://github.com/orgs/diffblue/teams/diffblue-opensource)
   team.

At this point, the rest of the process is automated, so we don't need to do
anything more, but the process is described below for reference:

3. `.github/workflows/regular-release.yaml` gets triggered on the `push`
   of the tag, and creates a Github release of the version that was
   described in the tag pushed (so, tag `cbmc-5.15.20` is going to
   create the release titled `cbmc-5.15.20` on the release page).

4. `.github/workflows/release-packages.yaml` gets triggered automatically
   at the creation of the release, and its job is to build packages for
   Windows, Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 (for now, we may support more
   specific Ubuntu versions later) and attaches them (after it has finished
   building them) to the release page as release artifacts.

   It also makes a PR to the homebrew repository that updates the version
   of CBMC in homebrew. That's then approved and merged by the maintainers
   of homebrew.

## Versioning

We adopt an approach approximating SemVer. That is, our version numbers should
be major.minor.patch. Regular releases (as of 2022-06-23: every other week)
should normally increment the minor version number. This is also where we can
deprecate undesired features, i.e., mark as deprecated, warn existing users.

Patch version increments should not be done as part of the regular releases, and
instead should be reserved for critical bugfixes and issues noticed in the
process of doing a regular release. Don't make a patch release if you're not
confident your release contains nothing but bugfixes.

Major version increments should be reserved for changes which we expect will
break downstream users scripts and/or workflows. This includes things like
changing the goto binary format in such a way that old outputs can't be read by
new version of our tools or vice versa, or removing deprecated functionality
(removal of functionality should generally be preceded by deprecation!). Note
that incrementing the major version every time a change technically could break
a downstream users scripts would lead to a weak signal, as basically any
detectable change including bugfixes can do that. Instead, major version
increments should signal that we expect many users will have to review their
workflows for potential breakages, not just any.

### Rust API versioning

Following discussions during the development of `libcprover_rust`, it was decided
that it would be easiest if the Rust API version was following the same scheme
that CBMC does, so that it's clear which version of the Rust API corresponds to
which version of CBMC.

This means that the Rust API has two "versions" it can report.

1. The library version, as reported in `Cargo.toml`, and
2. The (C++) API version, which is coming from CBMC and aligns with the version
   number in `config.inc` (reported via the `get_api_version()` API call).

Most of the time, these two numbers will be the same - but there can be scenarios
where they can diverge: if the user for example uses a later version of the
Rust API (say, `5.80.0`) to link against a static library representing an older
version of CBMC (say `5.79.0`).

## Constraints

Initial design of the release process suggested that the release cadence
of CBMC was going to be one regular release (incrementing the `y` part
of the version) every two weeks, on Thursday.

Originally we wanted to automate this part, but we were limited by the
fact that we needed to update `src/config.inc` before doing the release,
and that couldn't be done in an automated fashion, as any update needs
to go through a PR, and gets stuck on code-owners approvals, making the
whole process more manual than intended.

Following this original limitation, we decided to settle on doing manual
releases every two weeks, but having the process being initiated by a
developer manually making the change to `src/config.inc`, and after that
has been merged, mark that specific commit as with a version tag, and push
that version tag to Github. At that point, the rest of the process is automated.

The change to the current implementation was part of https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc/pull/5517.
