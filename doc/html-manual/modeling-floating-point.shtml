<h2>Floating Point</h2>

<p class="justified">CPROVER supports bit-accurate reasoning about
  IEEE-754 floating point and fixed point arithmetic.  The C standard
  contains a number of areas of implementation defined behaviour with
  regard to floating point:</p>

<p class="justified">
<ul>
<li>CPROVER supports C99 Appendix F and
  so <code>__STD_IEC_559__</code> macro is defined.  This means that
  the C <code>float</code> data type maps to IEEE
  754 <code>binary32</code> and <code>double</code> maps
  to <code>binary64</code> and operations on them are as specified in
  IEEE 754.</li>
<li><code>long double</code> can be configured to
  be <code>binary64</code>, <code>binary128</code> (quad precision) or
  a 96 bit type with 15 exponent bits and 80 significant bits.  The
  last is an approximation of x87 extended precision double data
  type.  The default value is matched to the build architecture.</li>
<li>In CPROVER, floating point expressions are evaluated at the
  'natural precision' (the greatest of the arguments) and not at a
  higher precision.  This corresponds to <code>FLT_EVAL_METHOD</code>
  set to <code>0</code>.  Note that this is a different policy to
  some platforms (see below).</li>
<li>Expression contraction (for example, converting <code>x * y +
    c</code> to <code>fma(x,y,c)</code>) is not performed.  In effect
    the <code>FP_CONTRACT</code> pragma is always off.</li>
<li>Constant expressions are only evaluated at `run' time and so will
  respect changes in the rounding mode.  In effect
  the <code>FENV_ACCESS</code> pragma is always off.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>x86 and Other Platform Specific Issues</h3>

<p class="justified">Not all platforms have the same implementation
  defined behaviour as CPROVER.  This can cause mismatches between
  the verification environment and the real environment.  If this
  occurs, check the compiler manual for the choices listed above.
  There are two common cases that can cause these problems: 32 bit
  x86 code and the use of unsafe optimisations.</p>

<p class="justified">Many compilers that target 32 bit x86 platforms
  employ a different evaluation method.  The extended precision
  format of the x87 unit is used for all computations regardless of
  their native precision.  Most of the time this results in more
  accurate results and avoiding edge cases.  However it can result in
  some obscure and difficult to debug behaviour.  Checking
  if the <code>FLT_EVAL_METHOD</code> macro is non-zero (for these
  platforms it will typically be 2) should warn of these problem.
  Changing the compiler flags to use the SSE registers will resolve
  many of them, give a more standards compliant platform and will
  likely perform better.  Thus it is <em>highly</em> recommended.
  <code>-msse2 -mfpmath=sse</code> enable this option for GCC.</p>

<p class="justified">The other common cause of discrepancy between
  CPROVER results and the actual platform are the use of unsafe
  optimisations.  Some higher optimisation levels enable
  transformations that are unsound with respect to the IEEE-754
  standard.  Consult the compiler manual and disable any
  optimisations that are described as unsafe (for
  example the GCC option <code>-ffast-math</code>).
  <code>-mno-fused-madd</code>, <code>-frounding-math</code>
  and <code>-fsignaling-nans</code> are needed for GCC to be strictly
  compliant with IEEE-754.</p>

<h3>Math Library</h3>

<p class="justified">CPROVER implements some of <code>math.h</code>,
  including <code>fabs</code>, <code>fpclassify</code>
  and <code>signbit</code>.  It has very limited support for
  elementary functions.  Care must be taken when verifying properties
  that are dependent on these functions as the accuracy of
  implementations can vary considerably.  The C compilers can (and
  many do) say that the accuracy of these functions are unknown.</p>

<h3>Fixed Point</h3>

<p class="justified">CPROVER also has support for fixed point types.
  The <code>--fixedbv</code> flag
  switches <code>float</code>, <code>double</code> and <code>long
  double</code> to fixed point types.  The length of these types is
  platform specific.  The upper half of each type is the integer
  component and the lower half is the fractional part.</p>
